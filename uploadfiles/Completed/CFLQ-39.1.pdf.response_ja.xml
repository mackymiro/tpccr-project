<para><b>The Cost of Shared Parenting: An Analysis of Section 9 from 2016 to 2017</b></para>
<para>Beth Ambury<sup>*</sup></para>
<para><b>1. INTRODUCTION</b></para>
<para>Section 9 of the Child Support Guidelines (‘‘the Guidelines”) sets out how to calculate child support for children in a shared parenting arrangement. This section only applies when each parent exercises significant physical care and control over the child measured in time.<sup>1</sup> The text of section 9 reads:</para>
<para>Where a spouse exercises a right of access to, or has physical custody of, a child for not less than 40 per cent of the time over the course of a year, the amount of the child support order must be determined by taking into account</para>
<para>(a) the amounts set out in the applicable tables for each of the spouses;</para>
<para>(b) the increased costs of shared custody arrangements; and</para>
<para>(c) the conditions, means, needs and other circumstances of each spouse and of any child for whom support is sought.<sup>2</sup></para>
<para>As interpreted by the Supreme Court of Canada in the leading case of Contino v. Leonelli-Contino (‘‘Contino”), section 9 sets out a two-step inquiry.<sup>3</sup> First, the court determines whether each parent has care of the child for at least 40% of the time. If that threshold is met, only then can the court consider the three listed factors to determine a quantum of support that meets the child’s needs in conjunction with the parents’ abilities to contribute to their support. Contino clarified several uncertain propositions under section 9, most notably: there was no presumption in favour of the table amount (as exists in section 3); there was no automatic reduction in support after meeting the 40% threshold; and there was no formulaic or mathematical approach to this section.<sup>4</sup> Contino</para>

<para>stressed that the language of section 9 emphasizes flexibility and fairness, which requires discretion by the trial judge to accord weight to each factor depending on the particular facts of each case.<sup>5</sup></para>
<para>Section 9 attempts to provide fair support for the child based on the parents’ abilities to pay. At play here are three kinds of spending that parents undertake for their children.<sup>6</sup> First, there are fixed and duplicated expenses, including housing, utilities, furniture, and household effects, the fixed part of motor vehicle costs, and some portion of clothing, toys, and personal effects. Second, there are variable costs that vary according to the time the child spends with the parent, such as food, the variable part of transportation costs like gas for travel between homes, some aspects of child care, recreation and entertainment expenses, vacation costs, and some school costs. Third, there are costs that do not relate to time at all, such as most clothing, some medical expenses, and extracurricular and school-related expenses. Section 9 deals with the first two, where fixed costs are generally similar for each parent and variable costs depend on the actual time spent with the child, while other sections of the Guidelines, such as section 7, deal with the third.</para>
<para>However, section 9 and the directives in Contino have proven difficult to apply across the country. From January 1, 2016, to July 31, 2017, a period of 18 months, there were 70 reported cases across Canada dealing with section 9 of the Guidelines.<sup>7</sup></para>

<para>This paper examines the courts’ analyses of the section 9 issues in these cases to seek out trends, identify common flaws, and suggest improvements that can be made by the federal government or by appellate courts. Some direction is certainly required, as section 9 still falls within the main objectives of the Guidelines:</para>
<para>(a) to establish a fair standard of support for children that ensures that they continue to benefit from the financial means of both spouses after separation;</para>
<para>(b) to reduce conflict and tension between spouses by making the calculation of child support orders more objective;</para>
<para>(c) to improve the efficiency of the legal process by giving courts and spouses guidance in setting the levels of child support orders and encouraging settlement; and</para>
<para>(d) to ensure consistent treatment of spouses and children who are in similar circumstances.<sup>8</sup></para>
<para>As currently applied, section 9 often undermines these goals as different applications by different courts create uncertainty in the application of the section, which in turn increases parental tensions as well as litigation. Consequently, in determining these child support issues, parents expend energy and resources that would be better spent on the children. Lead commentator Phil Epstein, along with others, has called for the revision of this section to provide a more formulaic way to address the shared parenting issue that provides more certainty for parties, counsel, and courts.<sup>9</sup> Any revisions to the section 9 application must remain child-focused, as the Guidelines intended.</para>
<para><b>2. ENGAGING SECTION 9</b></para>
<para>In order for the court to apply section 9 of the Guidelines, the court must first determine the threshold question: does a spouse exercise a right of access to, or have physical custody of, a child for not less than 40 per cent of the time over the course of a year? If that threshold is not met, there is no discretion for the court to apply section 9, and the parent must either pay table support under section 3 or rely on other provisions of the Guidelines for direction.</para>

<para><b>(b) Counting Time</b></para>
<para>The Contino test only applies after a parent has met the 40% threshold. In Contino itself, the mother did not dispute that the father had care of the child for at least 40% of the time.<sup>10</sup> Courts since have stressed that the court should avoid rigid calculations in this first step and instead look at whether physical custody of the children is truly shared.<sup>11</sup> These 70 cases presented three concrete options for counting time: by days, by overnights, or by hours. In the majority of the cases, however, the court did not specify what measure it was using to count to the 40% threshold because the cases were clearly equal time cases so there was no need to explain the unit of measure. Of the 61 cases that found the parent had met the 40% threshold, the court detailed the way time was counted in only seven cases. Of the nine cases where the parent did not meet the 40% threshold, however, the court detailed the way it counted time in all cases but one. The court thus appears to need to justify not reaching the 40% threshold, but does not need to justify meeting the 40% threshold.</para>

<para><i>(i) Method Unspecified</i></para>
<para>The majority of cases (84%) did not specify how the court counted a parent’s time. In nearly all of these cases, the court appears to have accepted that the parent crossed the 40% threshold without needing to explain why. In most of these cases, the parents shared parenting on a regular schedule that gave them equal time with the children, be it a week-about schedule,<sup>12</sup> a 2-2-3 day schedule,<sup>13</sup> a 4-3 day schedule,<sup>14</sup> or a three-month rotation schedule.<sup>15</sup> In these cases where the parenting appeared to be approximately equal, the court did not state what method it used to count time and moved on with the section 9 analysis. This appears to be an exercise in judicial realism. If the parties manage to agree that both parents exceed the 40% threshold, absent any power imbalance or red flags, the court did not disagree or pursue its own calculation to verify.</para>
<para>In four cases, the parties simply agreed that the 40% threshold had been reached without specifying the division of the children’s time between parents,</para>
<para><sup>12</sup> See, e.g. H. (N.) v. H. (B.), 2016 SKQB 153, 2016 CarswellSask 311 (Sask. Q.B.) [N.H. v. B.H.].</para>

<para>6 CANADIAN FAMILY LAW QUARTERLY [39 C.F.L.Q.]</para>
<para>and the court accepted that agreement to apply section 9. In S. (J.A.) v. S. (A.C.), the parties agreed that they shared parenting of their three children, and that they had ‘‘focussed more on providing their children with a flexible, fulsome relationship with both parents rather than on rigid schedules and record keeping.”<sup>16</sup> Bayliff Prov.J. applauded this child-focused attitude. In Harrison v. Falkenham, the parties agreed that their daughter had remained in a shared parenting agreement, and while each parent suggested that at times the child was more with one parent than the other, neither proved that she was with the other parent less than 40% of the time, so Jollimore J. applied section 9.<sup>17</sup> Similarly, in McCrate v. McCrate, the parties agreed that their three daughters would be in a shared parenting agreement, so Jollimore J. applied section 9.<sup>18</sup> Finally, the parties in B. (R.A.) v. R. (C.W.) settled the custody and access arrangements before trial, and the parties agreed that the three children would share time equally with both their parents, so Daley J.F.C. moved on to a section 9 analysis.<sup>19</sup></para>
<para>In one case, the court specifically declined to specify how it was counting time, as this would not be in the best interests of the child. There, in Pileggi v. Parkin, Clay J. outlined the father’s weekly access: Monday at 7:00 a.m. until Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. and Friday at 7:00 a.m. until Sunday at 4:30 p.m.<sup>20</sup> Even though the parties made some submissions about the nature of the time each spent with the child, the judge found that ‘‘there was no doubt that this is a time- sharing arrangement that fits within the shared custody provisions of s. 9 of the CSG.”<sup>21</sup> Clay J. went on to specifically discourage the father from counting hours with the child: ‘‘the parties share custody.”<sup>22</sup></para>
<para>Importantly, the cases that did not specify how time was counted almost all passed the threshold test. Conversely, the cases that failed the threshold test nearly all provided explanations for why the parent had failed to meet the 40% threshold. TLH v. MGD was the only case where the parent failed to meet the 40% threshold where the court did not specify how it counted time. In that case, the father asked the court to find he had passed the 40% threshold because he “wanted to, tried to, should’ve and could’ve” had the children in his care for that amount of time if the mother had not made accusations that he was abusing the</para>

<para>children.<sup>23</sup> Mahoney J. used a plain reading of section 9 to find that the court should not disregard existing parenting arrangements in favour of ‘‘different arrangements that ‘should have’ or ‘could have’ existed had circumstances been different,” because this would actually defeat many of the objectives of the Guidelines.<sup>24</sup> By no unit of measurement had this father reached the 40% threshold. The other cases where the parent did not pass the threshold are discussed below.</para>
<para><i>(ii) Days</i></para>
<para>Three cases used days to measure whether a parent had met the 40% threshold. This method has the benefit of easily measuring 40%; if a parent cares for the child at least 146 days out of 365 days per year, the threshold is passed. This is easy for the parties and the court to count, and its facility is its main attraction. However, this formula could also prove problematic in situations where parents share time with the children in the same day. Each parent could count the day or neither parent could count the day, or each could count part of the day, which negates the ease of the calculation.</para>
<para>In M. (F.) v. H. (T.), the New Brunswick Court of Appeal upheld the motions judge’s finding that the father had not met the 40% threshold.<sup>25</sup> The father submitted that the motions judge had erred by using days, not hours, to count his time with the child. The father worked four days then had four days off in an eight-day rotation, and had the child in his care beginning his second day off work until 6:00 p.m. the day prior to his return to work.<sup>26</sup> The appellate court validated days as a method for counting time. Furthermore, the panel reprimanded the father for suggesting that the motions judge had restructured the access arrangement to deliberately deny the father the 40% threshold; the motions judge had based the new arrangement on ‘‘the best interests of the child rather than with the minutiae of access time calculations,” which was the proper focus.<sup>27</sup></para>
<para>The Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal reversed the trial court decision in S. (H.) v. W. (P.) because the days of parenting time were incorrectly calculated. The court allowed the mother’s appeal for a variation in child support since the parties’ two children both lived primarily with her rather than equally with both parents as they had at the time of the previous order.<sup>28</sup> One child did not see the father at all, and the other child spent only three days with the father</para>

<para>out of every two weeks, which amounted ‘‘at most to 78 days or 21 percent of a 365-day year.”<sup>29</sup> Thus, the 40% threshold was not even close to being met and the judge had erred in exercising the discretion allowed under section 9 rather than applying the table amount to this child support situation.</para>
<para>In the British Columbia case of S. (E.L.) v. S. (C.A.), the parties were granted joint custody of their two children, with a parenting schedule that gave the father access for four days every two weeks (104 days per year) and meant he paid the table amount of support as section 9 was not engaged.<sup>30</sup> A few months later, Pearlman J. varied the parenting arrangement to a three-day, five-day rotation, where ‘‘[m]easured in days, [including designated holiday time,] the respondent’s parenting time over the course of the year is 149.31 days, or 40.9% of parenting time.”<sup>31</sup></para>
<para><i>(iii) Overnights</i></para>
<para>Three cases used overnights to measure a parent’s time. Like days, overnights offer a very simple and predictable method for determining whether the 40% threshold has been met. However, this method is problematic in situations where one parent cares for the child all day but gets no credit toward the 40% mark for that time because the other parent takes the child overnight. This method may be more appropriate for school-aged children, who spend a significant amount of time away from either parent’s direct control.</para>
<para>The Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal allowed the father’s appeal in C. (S.) v. H. (S.) where the trial judge found the father did not have care of the children for 40% of the time because he had failed to take into consideration the extra days outside of the regular schedule where the father worked onshore and had the children in his care.<sup>32</sup> The regular schedule provided that the father cared for the children for 16 overnights out of his forty-two-day work rotation, plus occasional additional overnights as his schedule allowed.<sup>33</sup> This amounted to 139 overnights per year, or 38% of the time.<sup>34</sup> Welsh J.A. found that even if the father only cared for the children for one extra night each work rotation onshore, he would care for them seven more overnights in the year which would amount to 146 overnights in a year, or 40% of the year.<sup>35</sup> The appeal court then remitted the case back to the trial judge to perform the section 9 analysis after determining the threshold had been met.<sup>36</sup></para>

<para>In Van Heighten v. Catarino, Clay J. revised the parenting schedule and found that the father met the threshold because the child slept at his house ‘‘13 nights out of 28 or 46% of the time.”<sup>37</sup> He then proceeded to apply the section 9 analysis to the child support calculation.</para>
<para>The court used overnights to find that the father had not crossed the 40% threshold in C. (J.C.) v. G. (R.B.). After separation, the parties’ two children lived primarily with the mother, but the father claimed that over the past few years, the children had spent more time with him than specified in the court order, and he now cared for them more than 40% of the time.<sup>38</sup> However, d’Entremont J. found that in a 14-day period, the father had the children overnight on Wednesday and then from Friday afternoon to Monday morning, plus a few hours after school and on weekdays where the children did not have school.<sup>39</sup> Overall, he cared for the children for five overnights in a 14-day period, whereas the mother cared for them for nine overnights in a 14-day period.<sup>40</sup> The judge was not convinced that the father had care of the children for at least 40% of the time and declined to apply section 9 to determine child support.<sup>41</sup></para>
<para><i>(iv) Hours</i></para>
<para>Five cases utilized hours to count time. Hours provide the most accurate accounting of a parent’s time with the children, but it also requires onerous calculations and time spent both calculating and arguing over how many hours the children actually spent with each parent. Furthermore, it raises difficulties when children spend significant hours of the day at school or with third parties. In that situation, neither parent has physical control of the child, but the parties can argue over who has the ultimate care for the child during those hours. What this ultimate care and control means when a child is physically with neither parent is unsettled and leaves room for further disagreement and prolonging of the conflict. Therefore, this method provides accuracy at the expense of time and conflict.</para>
<para>The Alberta Court of Appeal endorsed hours as an appropriate measure in Mackenzie v. Mackenzie in dismissing the father’s appeal.<sup>42</sup> His application for a retroactive child support adjustment was unsuccessful because he had not met the 40% threshold.<sup>43</sup> The father argued that the hours the daughter was in school should properly be attributed to him, not the mother, on the days that he</para>

<para>In M. (J.R.) v. H. (K.J.), Doulis Prov. J. used hours to demonstrate that the father had met the 40% threshold. Here, the parents shared time with the child in a bi-weekly parenting arrangement, but the 40% question depended on how the court allotted time that the child spent in school and daycare.<sup>47</sup> The judge declined to allot all school and daycare time to the mother, as she requested, and instead allocated it proportionally between the parties.<sup>48</sup> Using the mother’s calculations, the child was in her care 188 hours of the 336 hours in two weeks, or 56% of the time, and in the father’s care 44% of the time.<sup>49</sup> By the father’s calculations, the child was in his care for 159 of the 336 bi-weekly hours or 47% of the time, and in the mother’s care 177 hours bi-weekly or 53% of the time.<sup>50</sup> By either calculation, the father met the 40% threshold.<sup>51</sup> The mother further argued that because she was recently unemployed, her time with the child would increase to 205 hours bi-weekly or 61% of the time, but the court found that she had worked full-time for the past 4.5 years and had significant marketable skills, so she would likely return to work soon, at which point the father would regain his over-40% of the time over the course of a year.<sup>52</sup> The 40% threshold was met and section 9 applied.</para>
<para>In the Yukon, the court used hours to determine that the father had not met the threshold in M. (A.M.C.) v. L. (J.B.), despite his submission that his overnights amounted to 40%. Following the father’s recent application to increase time with the two children and reduce his table child support obligation accordingly, the court agreed to increase his parenting time to include one additional overnight every other week with one of the two children.<sup>53</sup> But this</para>

<para>was the father’s third application from 2014 to 2016, and the court criticized this campaign to decrease child support. It did not seem that the father was pursuing extra time for the best interests of the children, but rather because he believed it was unfair that he was required to pay the table amount of child support to the mother who made twice as much income as he did.<sup>54</sup> Given the new parenting schedule ordered, one child spent three overnights with the father over two weeks, and the other child spent four overnights with the father, plus weekday access from 3:00 p.m. until 6:15 p.m. and shared summer access.<sup>55</sup> The father calculated his time with the children since the July 2016 order as 40% of the time, whereas the mother calculated his time with the children as 34.8% of the time.<sup>56</sup> The court found that the father still did not meet the 40% threshold because he had not increased his time to 40% ‘‘over the course of a year”.<sup>57</sup> A year had not yet passed since the order that set out this parenting time and it remained to be seen whether he would spend the outlined time with the children, so his application to decrease child support was premature.<sup>58</sup> The judge warned that even if a year had passed, and even if the court excluded the children’s time in school during which the mother exercised care and control over the children, the most generous calculation of the father’s time with the children was only 36%, so section 9 would not apply.<sup>59</sup></para>
<para>In the Ontario case of Chomos v. Hamilton, the court awarded the mother sole custody of the parties’ three-year-old child<sup>60</sup> and set out the timesharing schedule by week in a repeating 28-day cycle. The father had access to the child during Week 1 from Friday at 10:00 a.m. until Wednesday at 7:00 p.m., during Week 2 from Monday at 10:00 a.m. until Thursday at 7:00 p.m., and during Week 4 from Thursday at 10:00 a.m. to Sunday at 5:00 p.m.<sup>61</sup> From this schedule, Pazaratz J. applied section 9.<sup>62</sup> While the judge does not explicitly state that hours were used to reach the threshold, the specificity of the hours in the parenting schedule suggests this was the counting method.<sup>63</sup></para>

<para><sup>63</sup> In a 28-day period, there are 672 hours. The father cared for the child for 129 hours during Week 1, for 81 hours during Week 2, and for 79 hours during Week 3, for a total of 289 hours, or 43%, of the 28-day period. The threshold is therefore crossed.</para>

<para>In F. (J.) v. F. (G.), Justice Ferguson used hours to determine that the father had not crossed the 40% threshold. The parties had two teenage children, but the eldest was living with an aunt in Michigan, so the court recognized this was a special circumstance where it was only concerned about the custody and access arrangement for the younger child for child support purposes.<sup>64</sup> The father exercised access to the child from Monday at 8:00 a.m. until Tuesday at 6:00 p.m. (34 hours) and every second weekend from Friday at 7:30 p.m. until Sunday at 4:00 p.m. (45.5 hours every other week).<sup>65</sup> The court then applied the following formula: 26 weekends times 45.5 hours equals 1183 total hours on weekends per year, plus weekly access of 52 times 34 hours equals 1768 hours per year. This equals total access per year of 1183 hours (weekends) plus 1768 hours (weekdays) which is 2951 total access hours per year.<sup>66</sup> The court then divided that by 52 weeks in a year to find an average access per week of 56.75 hours, less than the 67.2 hours per week of a total 168 hours in a week to reach the 40% threshold.<sup>67</sup> Therefore, section 9 did not apply.</para>
<para><b>3. ELEMENTS OF SECTION 9</b></para>
<para>In Contino, the Court interpreted the wording of section 9 as imperative: once the 40% threshold is met, the court must use the three listed factors to structure its discretion in determining the appropriate quantum of child support.<sup>68</sup> As a reminder, the three considerations under section 9 are (emphasis added):</para>
<para>(a) the amounts set out in the applicable tables for each of the spouses;</para>
<para>(b) the increased costs of shared custody arrangements; and</para>
<para>(c) the conditions, means, needs and other circumstances of each spouse and of any child for whom support is sought.</para>
<para>Once the court determines the straight set-off under section 9(a), that amount can be increased or decreased based on the factors in section 9(b) and section 9(c). It is important to note that these factors are meant to work in tandem with each other, not in isolation, as the factors are inextricably linked to each other and the court’s conclusion. Thus, while there is value in examining each section individually, that is only a partial representation of what is going on in each context-specific case.<sup>69</sup> For this reason, I will expand on each of the</para>

<para>sections separately, then put forth a complete analysis that shows how the court applies the section as a whole.</para>
<para><b>(a) Section 9(a)</b></para>
<para>Section 9(a) is ‘‘the starting point”<sup>70</sup> for a section 9 analysis. All the cases that met the 40% threshold went on to discuss this section. It is relatively straightforward. The court determines what amount each parent would pay the other as if there was no shared parenting arrangement and each parent were seeking full table support from the other, then subtracts the lower number from the higher number.<sup>71</sup> The purpose of section 9(a) is to approximate the average amount a parent would spend on their child based on their incomes. It does not, however, represent the maximum the payor can afford or the minimum that he or she should be required to pay.<sup>72</sup> This starting point emphasizes that, first, both parents must contribute to the support of their child and, second, it reminds the court to consider each parent’s fixed and variable costs before making adjustments to reach a fair outcome.<sup>73</sup> However, it has no presumptive value.<sup>74</sup> In particular, when the issue is a variation of support, the set-off often requires adjustment to prevent a ‘‘cliff effect,” where a parent’s support obligation decreases markedly from the table amount by assuming that parent is spending more on the children based on increased time, when this in fact may not be the case at all.<sup>75</sup></para>
<para>A typical section 9(a) analysis is found in H. (N.) v. H. (B.), where Sandomirsky J. determined the set-off amount under section 9(a) after having ordered a shared parenting arrangement.<sup>76</sup> The mother’s income was $88,374, which created a table obligation of $1,578 per month, and the father’s income was $41,823, which created a table obligation of $751 per month.<sup>77</sup> The judge subtracted $751 from $1,578 to find that under the straight set-off, the payor mother would pay the father $827 per month.<sup>78</sup> This calculation meets the requirements of section 9(a).</para>

<para>section recognizes that the costs of raising children in a shared custody arrangement may be greater than in sole custody arrangements, with duplicated costs for housing, food, supplies, and transportation costs between houses.<sup>79</sup> However, a court may not assume that costs are greater in this situation; the parties must provide detailed budgets and child care expenses for each parent to guide analysis.<sup>80</sup> The court can then determine the total amount of expenses attributable to each of the parties and the parents’ abilities to pay in accordance with their incomes.<sup>81</sup> The court should then calculate the ratio of income between the parties to determine their abilities to absorb the child’s expenses and the increased costs of the parenting arrangement.<sup>82</sup> Next the court examines how much the payor parent is actually already contributing to the child’s expenses.<sup>83</sup></para>
<para>The focus of this section is to discern the increased total costs of caring for the child in the shared parenting arrangement, and to ensure that the child- related expenses are fairly apportioned between the parents based on their incomes. The court can verify that the set-off accounts for this cost or can vary the set-off to apportion the costs fairly if necessary. In this analysis, judges require significant and specific direct evidence of the parents’ actual costs attributed to parenting. The following cases show a handful of situations where the court accepted or rejected parents’ submissions on the increased costs of shared parenting.</para>
<para>Often, the court examined the parties’ submissions on section 9(b) and dismissed the claim for increased costs. For example, in E. (C.A.) v. C. (S.W.), the mother claimed that despite the shared parenting she primarily bore the costs of the children’s clothing, food, school supplies (which were expensive due to the children’s learning disabilities), and extracurricular costs.<sup>84</sup> Saunders J. found ‘‘scant evidence”<sup>85</sup> to support this, and determined that the straight set-off amount met the children’s needs.<sup>86</sup> Similarly, in M. (J.R.) v. H. (K.J.), Doulis Prov. J. found no increased costs from shared parenting that merited departing from the set-off.<sup>87</sup> This was despite accepting that childcare costs were greater now that both parties were working to pay their separate housing costs, and that the 20 to 25 minute drive to transport the child between houses was ‘‘not trivial.”<sup>88</sup> In McCrate v.

<para>In L. (G.J.) v. L. (M.J.), Schultes J. ordered the father pay the straight set- off after a detailed accounting of the increased costs of shared parenting outlined in the parties’ detailed monthly budgets.<sup>90</sup> The court determined that there were increased costs due to the shared parenting arrangement, but the court did not accept all the parties’ claims. For example, the father claimed homeowner insurance, strata fees and utilities as increased costs from the children, but did not show how these would be any lower if the children did not live with him half of the time.<sup>91</sup> The court found that the children’s total monthly expenses equaled $3,664.<sup>92</sup> The parents’ income ratio was 75:25, and based on this the father would pay $2,748 of these expenses and the mother would pay $916.<sup>93</sup> The difference between those amounts was $1,832, or $207 higher than the straight set-off.<sup>94</sup> However, the court declined to depart from the straight set-off because there was no real disparity in the standards of living in each home and the mother was already benefiting slightly more than the father from their sharing of the children’s common expenses.<sup>95</sup></para>
<para>Masuhara J. accepted in the case of K. (O.) v. K. (V.) that the father had incurred additional costs from the shared parenting arrangement, because he was ordered to vacate the family home and find a residence that could accommodate not just him but the two children as well.<sup>96</sup> Although the father claimed these costs, including ‘‘new beds, computers, clothing, and moving expenses,” the judge found that the sum proposed as additional costs due to shared parenting ($12,000) was an overstatement and set the actual cost under section 9(b) at $4,000.<sup>97</sup> The court therefore determined that the father should pay the set-off, minus $83 per month which amounts to his $4,000 set-up costs amortized over 48 months.<sup>98</sup></para>

First, the court looks at the parents’ circumstances—including their assets, liabilities, and income disparities—to ensure they are each making a fair contribution to the child(ren)’s standard of support.<sup>100</sup> Then the court looks to see whether the parents’ circumstances create different standards of living for the child(ren) in the two houses, as Contino did not intend for children to suffer a noticeable decline in their standard of living depending on which parent has the child in their care.<sup>101</sup> Thompson suggests that each parent’s net disposable income (NDI) per month serves as an appropriate measure of the standard of living in each home, and a 50/50 split of the parents’ combined NDIs is fair.<sup>102</sup> Of course, this calculation only applies in bi-nuclear cases, where there are no new spouses, and all the children being supported share their time between homes.<sup>103</sup> The circumstances the court considered significant under section 9(c) included the parties’ household incomes, support of other dependents, new spouses and their financial contribution, assets, debts, discretionary spending, employment costs, and income disparities.</para>
<para><i>(i) No Change to the Set-Off</i></para>
<para>In L. (G.J.) v. L. (M.J.), Schultes J. found that despite the father’s higher income, the parents’ standards of living were not disparate: the mother’s home was a higher value and her mortgage smaller due to her partner’s contribution, the father’s vehicle was more valuable, the father had more liquid assets, and the mother’s pensions and RRSP totals were somewhat higher.<sup>104</sup> The mother’s ability to take the children on vacation was due to her good financial planning, not a reflection of a significantly higher standard of living under her care.<sup>105</sup> Based on these factors, the judge determined that the standards of living would equalize where the father paid the set-off amount in child support.<sup>106</sup></para>
<para>The court found clear differences in the parties’ lifestyles in E. (C.A.) v. C. (S.W.), but still ordered the straight set-off.<sup>107</sup> The mother and her new spouse made a combined income of $95,000, but the court agreed with the father that there was a greater-than-expected standard of living in this household because of co-mingling with the new spouse’s corporate accounts for his family business.<sup>108</sup></para>

<para>Their home was leveraged by debt but valued at $810,000 before they undertook at $100,000 renovation, and they shared part ownership of a vacation home with a boat.<sup>109</sup> The father and his new partner had a combined income of $200,000, but they maintained separate finances.<sup>110</sup> They lived in a trailer on a 10-acre rural property valued at $512,000, complete with a riding area, barn, and animals the children helped care for.<sup>111</sup> Saunders J. found that one could not conclude that one standard of living was superior to the other, or that the differences were even capable of being quantified and equalized through reapportionment of child support under section 9.<sup>112</sup></para>
<para>In M. (J.R.) v. H. (K.J.), Doulis Prov. J. considered several factors under section 9(c), but nevertheless concluded that the straight set-off amount ‘‘is not going to result in a figure which is unrealistic or undermines the Guideline goal of ensuring a consistent standard of living for [the child] across both households.”<sup>113</sup> The judge determined that the parties’ incomes, expenses, education, and lifestyles were modest but similar, that they paid for childcare equally, that the father bore most of the transportation costs between homes, and that the mother had continued to receive child benefits.<sup>114</sup> In addition, both had recently struggled financially: the mother had lost her job but still had more assets and less debt than the father, while the father had fallen ill, relied on employment insurance and social assistance, and recently declared bankruptcy.<sup>115</sup></para>
<para>The court found in Kimmerly v. Hensche that there was a slight difference in the parties’ standards of living, but not enough to warrant varying the set-off amount under section 9(c).<sup>116</sup> The father’s combined household income with his new spouse was $124,000, while the mother’s was $132,000.<sup>117</sup> Ross J. agreed that there was a slightly higher standard of living at the mother’s home, both in income and because the father had three new dependents.<sup>118</sup> However, this slight difference was offset by the mother’s debts from a failed business venture, and the judge dismissed the father’s claim for undue hardship and a decrease to the set-off founded on the difference in standards of living.<sup>119</sup></para>

McCrate.<sup>135</sup> The father’s income ($112,374) was more than double the mother’s income ($49,363), and the mother assumed more costs for the children’s medical and dental costs, clothing purchases, and extra-curricular expenses.<sup>136</sup> The father’s budget showed he was spending more than the mother could afford on groceries and clothing, and his budget provided for twice as much toward entertainment and vacations.<sup>137</sup> Both parents were searching for new houses, having just sold the matrimonial home, so it was unknown how this would affect the children’s standards of living.<sup>138</sup> However, the father had retained ownership of the cottage, with an above-ground pool and bunkhouse for the children’s enjoyment.<sup>139</sup> The judge found that while the set-off amount compensated the mother for direct parenting costs she alone bore for the children, it would not allow her to maintain a similar level of comfort for the children.<sup>140</sup> Therefore, the court ordered the father to pay support in the amount of $1,700 per month rather than the set-off amount of $1,153.<sup>141</sup></para>

<para>In Aguirre v. Aguirre, Doyle J. relied largely on section 9(c) to find no child support payable.<sup>142</sup> While the mother’s income was higher ($45,000) than the father’s ($28,000), which should have resulted in a support obligation, the judge acknowledged that the father received benefits from his family that supplemented his income, while the mother was supporting three children from a previous relationship without support from the other children’s father.<sup>143</sup> Therefore, a decrease to the set-off was appropriate to adjust the mother’s monthly obligation.</para>
<para>The court decreased the set-off amount in McKale v. McKale, because of section 9(b) and section 9(c) considered together.<sup>144</sup> Under section 9(c), Johnston J. found that both parties were struggling financially.<sup>145</sup> However, the father’s struggle was temporary and due to re-training to find employment in the social work field.<sup>146</sup> By contrast, the mother’s struggle was not temporary and she was having difficulty paying the mortgage, utilities, and household expenses required for the children’s standard of living.<sup>147</sup> The mother was also supporting an adult daughter from a previous relationship who was unable to support herself while pursuing post-secondary education, so the judge had to balance her obligation to other children along with this child.<sup>148</sup> Therefore, the court reduced the mother’s child support obligation from $788 per month to $750 per month.<sup>149</sup></para>

<para>his projected income per year.<sup>151</sup> However, his income had not increased as expected and he sought to vary his obligation based on section 9.<sup>152</sup></para>
<para>First, under section 9(a) McCarthy J. determined the father’s current income was $712,720, while the mother’s income was only $47,700, which resulted in the father’s set-off obligation of $5,983 per month.<sup>153</sup></para>
<para>Under section 9(b), the judge then relied on the parents’ expense reports to determine that they spent a combined $6,285 per month on the child.<sup>154</sup> McCarthy J. then found that based on their income ratios, where the father made 94.73% of the parties’ combined income, the father should pay 95% of the child’s expenses, or $5,971.<sup>155</sup> Since the father already paid $1,886 while the child was in his care, this meant that he should be paying the mother $4,085 to cover the remainder of his share of the child’s expenses.<sup>156</sup> The judge then verified the actual costs the parents were expending on the child: the father was currently contributing $8,253 per month ($6,367 in child support paid to the mother plus $1,886 in child costs paid directly), much more than his table obligation or the child’s actual expenses in a month.<sup>157</sup></para>
<para>Under section 9(c), McCarthy J. first examined the circumstances of each parent. The mother’s budget was not ‘‘entirely unreasonable” because it was based on her expectation of receiving full table support from the father, and the judge acknowledged her fixed costs and debt payments from lines of credit she took out to support the child in the past.<sup>158</sup> The high amount the father was paying for the child’s support had to be examined in the context that he had greater ability to absorb the increased costs of shared parenting than the mother, but that he also had a new spouse and dependents to support.<sup>159</sup> In addition, the judge was not satisfied the child experienced a significant variation in standard of living between his parents’ homes.<sup>160</sup></para>
<para>Based on fairness and flexibility, McCarthy J. fixed the father’s support obligation at $5,000 per month, which still exceeded the child’s actual needs and discretionary expenses.<sup>161</sup> This case illustrates how difficult it is to examine one factor of section 9 in isolation of the others.</para>

<para><b>(a) Straight Set-Off</b></para>
<para>In 38 (85%) of the cases, the judge ultimately ordered the parents to pay the straight set-off amount after considering section 9, with varying degrees of attention to each subsection. It is significant that the vast majority of cases resolve with this resulting quantum, as will be further explored in Part VI of this paper. In the majority of these cases (79%), the court determined the straight set- off amount was appropriate by considering section 9, with varying degrees of attention to each subsection.<sup>162</sup> In a minority of these straight set-off cases (21%), the court ordered the straight set-off amount because the parties agreed to it, whether overtly<sup>163</sup> or by declining to lead evidence for the court to weigh the section 9(b) and section 9(c) factors.<sup>164</sup> Sometimes, the parents suggested this</para>

<para>was the appropriate amount payable,<sup>165</sup> often to avoid the cost and time of putting forth evidence on the additional section 9 factors.<sup>166</sup> Sometimes the parents agreed to the straight set-off in in a previous separation agreement or court order and the court concluded this amount was still appropriate.<sup>167</sup> In the following two cases, the straight set-off resulted in zero support payable.</para>
<para>In Nderitu v. Kamoji, the parties’ incomes were too similar to warrant a prospective child support order. Shelston J. determined that for the current year, the mother’s income was $72,762 and the father’s income was $72,000.<sup>168</sup> Since both parties had approximately the same income, no child support was payable under the set-off.<sup>169</sup> Additionally, the court found the set-off amount for the two previous years left the father in arrears in the amount of $1,614, which the father would pay in a lump sum following this order to end their financial relationship and minimize conflict between the parties.<sup>170</sup></para>
<para>Cole J. found that the parties’ incomes for support purposes were relatively equal and did not merit a support order in MacDonald v. Burnett. The father had applied to vary child support set out in the parties’ separation agreement, as he alleged the children’s standard of living at the mother’s home was greater.<sup>171</sup> The judge determined the mother’s income was $77,518, while the father’s reported income was only $31,926 because he had been laid off from his company and begun working as a self-employed electrician rather than earning his previous salary which was approximately equal to the mother’s.<sup>172</sup> However, the judge imputed income of $70,000 to the father because his unwillingness to travel outside of his home county to jobs available within an hour’s drive was unreasonable, even if it was based on good intentions to be available to pick the children up from school.<sup>173</sup> He still had a responsibility to provide for them financially, and if he widened his work area, his income would increase to approximately the same level as before.<sup>174</sup> Based on that imputed income, the</para>

<para><b>(b) Higher than Set-Off</b></para>
<para>In three (6%) of these non-hybrid cases, the court used its discretion under section 9(b) and section 9(c) to order an amount payable higher than the straight set-off determined under section 9(a). In these cases, the court’s reasons for ordering a higher amount of child support included high income payors, status quo, and equalizing standards of living in both parents’ homes.</para>
<para>In Van Heighten v. Catarino, Clay J. varied the parenting arrangement set out in the parties’ separation agreement. Under the new arrangement, the parties still shared nearly equal time with their son, but the mother had him in her care on most school nights in order to provide the child with greater consistency.<sup>176</sup> The father’s income was $69,200 and the mother’s modest income from accident insurance was $13,411.<sup>177</sup> Under section 9(c), the judge found that the income disparity required the father to pay the set-off amount plus an additional $100<sup>178</sup> per month to address the increased costs of shared custody.<sup>179</sup> Clay J. specified that in the future, the parties should determine the set-off amount based on their income tax returns, and then add $100 per month to the amount payable, so the parties could easily re-calculate prospective child support themselves in the future without returning to court.<sup>180</sup></para>
<para>Pearlman J. granted the father’s application for shared parenting in S. (E.L.) v. S. (C.A.), since his new work schedule allowed him to care for the children more days per week.<sup>181</sup> When the parties had first separated, the father’s work schedule meant that the two children resided primarily with the mother, so the father paid her the table amount in child support.<sup>182</sup> At variation, the father’s imputed income for support purposes (due to rental income) was $92,506 and the mother’s income was $83,919, creating table support obligations of $1,378 and $1,264, respectively.<sup>183</sup> Despite the change in parenting time, after considering the factors under section 9(b) and section 9(c), Pearlman J. found that reducing the father’s support payments to the set-off amount of $114 ‘‘would undermine [the mother’s] ability to bear the costs required to maintain the modest but comfortable standard of living the children enjoy while in her care.”<sup>184</sup></para>

<para>In V. (R.A.) v. M. (J.M.), the parties had previously agreed that the father would pay $400 per month in support, an amount below the set-off amount of $521 per month.<sup>186</sup> While both parties’ incomes had increased, the father’s had increased much more (from $150,000 to $330,443) compared to the mother’s (from $86,000 to $93,569).<sup>187</sup> The judge took into account the slightly higher standard of living the child would enjoy at his father’s home, the parents’ increased incomes, the previous agreement, and payments made in the past. Ultimately, Arnold-Bailey J. made a ‘‘fair and flexible” determination that the father should pay $900 per month in child support, rather than the set-off amount of $600 per month.<sup>188</sup></para>
<para><b>(c) Lower than Set-Off</b></para>

<para>In S. (M.) v. S. (E.J.), the parties shared parenting time of their two teenagers.<sup>190</sup> Murray J. imputed income to both parents and determined that, under the set-off, the father would be responsible for paying the mother $393 per month, based on the mother’s imputed income of $72,000 and the father’s income of $100,541.<sup>191</sup> However, because of the factors in section 9 (the court did not elaborate), especially the discrepancy in the costs to the parties of maintaining their households, the judge decreased this obligation to $350 per month.<sup>192</sup></para>

<para>In five additional cases, the court declined to make a finding on the appropriate quantum of support, either by remitting back to the trial court for that finding, or by adjourning the proceedings until the parents provided sufficient disclosure to allow the court to complete a section 9 analysis. In two cases, the court ordered some other amount of support for a shared parenting arrangement, not based on the set-off at all. In the one remaining case, the court made some other arrangement that was so specific to the individual parties that the order was statistically insignificant.<sup>196</sup></para>
<para><i>(i) No quantum finding made</i></para>
<para>In F. (G.) v. F. (J.A.C.), the New Brunswick Court of Appeal determined that the trial court had erred in law by failing to consider the mandatory criteria set out in section 9(b) and section 9(c) before ordering the set-off amount of child support, and remitted the case back to the trial court.<sup>197</sup> The appellate court emphasized that it was mandatory under section 9 to consider ‘‘the budgets of the respective parties, the incomes of new partners, to review s. 7 expenses, to compare the households’ standards of living, and other financial information that permits for a meaningful analysis.”<sup>198</sup></para>
<para>Similarly, the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal found in C. (S.) v. H. (S.) that the trial court had erred by finding the father did not meet the 40% threshold.<sup>199</sup> Having established that section 9 was engaged, it remitted the case back to the trial court because consideration of the section 9 factors on the evidence ‘‘is a matter properly undertaken by the trial judge.”<sup>200</sup></para>
<para>In Jellis v.

<para><sup>196</sup> In this final case, the court found that section 9 was no longer applicable. The new order in Simms v. Brown, supra note 121, changed the parenting arrangement from shared custody to primary residence with the mother due to the parents’ continuing hostilities toward each other. The court dismissed the father’s claim that he should continue to pay support based on the set-off under section 9. Section 9 was no longer applicable to the parenting arrangement, so the court ordered the father to begin paying full table support for the two children.</para>

<para>The judge adjourned the child support determination to a later date in L. (P.) c. D. (M.). These parents lived 2.5 hours apart (in Rimouski, Quebec, and Campbelltown, New Brunswick), and Landry J. ordered the child to share equal time with both parents until he started school.<sup>202</sup> The child support issue was complicated by the father claiming an imputed income to the mother and difficulties with improper pleadings.<sup>203</sup> Given these complexities, and since the parties would likely have to come back to court to decide where the child would live primarily when he began school anyway, the judge adjourned the determination of child support until that time.<sup>204</sup></para>
<para>Similarly, in Richard v. Welner, the court postponed determination of the child support quantum until the parties’ situation clarified. D’Entremont J. had dismissed the mother’s application to relocate with the child. Until she decided whether to stay in the same city as the child and share parenting with the father or relocate by herself without the child, the judge could not know whether to apply section 9 or section 3 to her child support obligation, so there was insufficient evidence to order child support until the mother acted.<sup>205</sup></para>

<para>Doyle J. determined that the 17-year-old son with severe autism in Brown v.

<para>There are two approaches for calculating support available to the court in this situation: the ‘‘economies of scale” approach and the ‘‘two-step” approach.<sup>211</sup> Generally, the ‘‘economies of scale” approach is favoured in Ontario, British Columbia, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland and Labrador while the ‘‘two-step” approach is favoured in Saskatchewan, Yukon, and the Northwest Territories.<sup>212</sup> The recent cases, however, do not always clearly state which method is being used.</para>
<para><b>(a) ‘‘Economies of Scale” Approach</b></para>
<para>The ‘‘economies of scale” approach is based on the concept that economies of scale are built into the Guidelines. For example, the table amount payable for two children is less than two times the table amount payable for one child because there are certain expenses that do not change whether there is one child or three. For example, the Ontario table amount payable by a parent with an</para>

<para>income of $50,000 would be $461 per month for one child, but $755 per month for two children, or $294 per month for the second child.</para>
<para>Under this approach, the court applies section 9 using the different table amounts for each parent’s situation depending on how many children are in their care. For example, consider a situation where one child lives primarily with the father and the second child lives with both parents equally. The proper support figure would be the mother’s table amount for two children and the father’s table amount for one child. If the father’s income is $50,000 and the mother’s income is $70,000, the father’s Ontario table amount for one child is $461 and the mother’s for two children is $1,067 per month. The mother would therefore owe a set-off of $606 per month. Then the court may adjust the set-off amount payable using section 9(b) and section 9(c) to reach a fair quantum.</para>
<para>In the Ontario case of Smith v. Smith, the eldest daughter lived primarily with the mother, while the younger two daughters were in a shared parenting arrangement.<sup>213</sup> Fitzpatrick J. explicitly chose to follow the ‘‘economies of scale” approach, because ‘‘the guiding objective must be to set child support in an amount that ensures that the children do not suffer markedly different experiences flowing from financial disparities between each parent.”<sup>214</sup> The judge then calculated the father’s table obligation for three children and the mother’s obligation for two children to find the straight set-off amount payable by the father to the mother was $2,251.<sup>215</sup> Combined with the spousal support payable, this meant that the mother’s household would have 55% of the family’s net disposable income, which was appropriate because the eldest child resided rimaril with her so the strai ht set-off amount did not need adjustment <sup>216</sup></para>

<para>In Nova Scotia, Jollimore J. calculated child support in Harrison v. Falkenham for a period of time where the youngest daughter lived in a shared parenting arrangement while the son lived primarily with the mother.<sup>226</sup> Jollimore J. specifically employed the ‘‘economies of scale” approach: first, she determined the amount of support the father would pay the mother for the daughter and son’s support, then she offset this against the amount the mother would pay the father for the daughter in shared custody, and then she completed the section 9 analysis by considering section 9(b) and section 9(c).<sup>227</sup> The court ordered the straight set-off was appropriate, as neither party produced evidence of the increased costs of shared parenting, and their conditions, means, and other circumstances were similar.<sup>228</sup></para>

<para>In another British Columbia case, Masuhara J. determined child support for two children where the son lived primarily with the mother and the daughter shared her time equally between both parents in K. (O.) v. K. (V.).<sup>232</sup> The judge used the straight set-off amount of the father’s table amount payable for two children and the mother’s table amount payable for one child to find the set-off payable by the father to the mother was $1,083.<sup>233</sup> Then the court reduced the father’s obligation by $83 per month based on increased expenses for setting up a new home to arrive at the child support payment of approximately $1,000 per month prospectively.<sup>234</sup></para>
<para><b>(b) ‘‘Two-Step” Approach</b></para>
<para>The ‘‘two-step” approach applies a combination of section 3 and section 9 to the parenting arrangement. Under this approach, the court first calculates the full table amount payable for the child(ren) in the other parent’s primary care under section 3, then separately determines the set-off amount payable for the child(ren) in a shared arrangement under section 9, using the one-child table amounts again, and then adds these numbers together to determine the total amount payable. For example, if one child lives primarily with the father and the second child lives with both parents equally, the court would first determine the mother’s table support obligation for one child living primarily with the father, and then perform the set-off calculation under section 9 for the second child living in a shared arrangement. As above, consider the father’s income is $50,000 and the mother’s income is $70,000. At step one the court would determine that the mother’s obligation to support the first child would be $654 per month. Then at step two the court would determine that the mother’s table amount for the second child would be $654 per month (again, the one-child table amount) and the father’s would be $461 per month, so the set-off amount for this child would be $193 per month. Assuming no adjustment under the section 9(b) or section 9(c) factors for the second child, the mother’s combined support obligation for the two children would therefore be $847 per month. This would be significantly higher than her $606 per month obligation under the ‘‘economies of scale” approach.</para>

<para>In Burgess v. Burgess, the Newfoundland Court of Appeal used the two-step approach. The parties agreed in a separation agreement that no child support would be payable given similar incomes and equal parenting time; however, the daughter had since begun living primarily with the mother while the son remained in a shared parenting arrangement.<sup>235</sup> The mother applied for child support given the changed custody arrangement and the father’s increased income since separation.<sup>236</sup> The province’s appellate court found that the trial judge had erred twice: first by finding there was no change in circumstance with regard to the son, so no child support was payable for him based on the separation agreement, and second by finding that child support for the daughter should be calculated using the set-off method under section 9.<sup>237</sup> There had been a material change in circumstances to warrant changing child support payable for the son because of the father’s increased income, and calculating the set-off amount would account for the discrepancy in the parents’ incomes.<sup>238</sup> Additionally, the daughter was not in a shared parenting arrangement, so section 9 was not applicable to her; instead, the table amount for one child applied to her.<sup>239</sup> Welsh J.A. therefore employed the ‘‘two-step” approach in this hybrid parenting arrangement, but remitted the case to the trial judge for re- calculation, so information on the actual quantum of support ordered is not available.</para>

<para><b>6. ANALYSIS AND SUGGESTED REVISIONS</b></para>
<para>As evidenced by the general trends found in this survey of 70 cases, section 9 has proven difficult to apply, which has resulted in disparate results across cases and jurisdictions. Epstein has stated that a full Contino analysis is beyond the ability of most self-represented litigants, ‘‘and frankly, most family law counsel,”<sup>258</sup> and has called for changes to the current impractical approach to section 9. This section of the paper attempts to isolate areas where legislation or appellate courts could step in to clarify or simplify the application of the section.</para>
<para>In making these recommendations, I have particularly taken into account that an increased number of family litigants are now self-represented and require straightforward directions from the court in order to access justice for themselves and their children. I also suggest that the court must keep in mind that children deserve fair support from each of their parents and remind litigants of this overarching goal if the litigants lose sight of it. Theoretically, parents who are able to share custody and significant time with their children should be able to agree that the children deserve support according to each parent’s resources for the finite amount of time the children require support. I have also kept in mind the objectives of the Guidelines as a whole, as section 9 must continue to fit within the larger scheme.<sup>259</sup></para>
<para>The Court in Contino acknowledged that these objectives create ‘‘a palpable tension” with section 9.<sup>260</sup> Bastarache J. stated that in section 9, Parliament deliberately chose to emphasize the objectives of fairness, flexibility, and recognition of the actual conditions, means, needs, and other circumstances of parents and children, often to the detriment of predictability, consistency, and efficiency.<sup>261</sup> This was a response to the ‘‘wide range of situations of shared custody depicting the reality of different families.”<sup>262</sup> While the goal of adapting</para>

<para>support to the needs of each family is very commendable, the amount of discretion and evidence required to fulfill these requirements has proven too burdensome in practice. Now that the courts have been attempting to apply this framework for over a decade, it seems it is time to re-examine this balance.</para>
<para>Accordingly, I propose four broad adjustments to the interpretation and application of section 9:</para>
<para>1) Lower the degree of scrutiny accorded to the 40% threshold to make it easier for parties to pass the threshold.</para>
<para>2) Create a rebuttable presumption in favour of the straight set-off under section 9(a), with the option but not the requirement to examine the factors under section 9(b) and section 9(c).</para>
<para>3) Make equalizing the net disposable incomes (NDI) of each parent’s household the ultimate goal when adjusting the quantum of support under section 9(b) and section 9(c).</para>
<para>4) Clarify that the correct analysis for child support quantum in hybrid parenting arrangements is the ‘‘economies of scale” approach, not the ‘‘two-step” approach.</para>
<para><b>(a) 40% Threshold: Making the threshold less insurmountable</b></para>
<para>When parties seek to invoke section 9, it is mandatory that they pass the 40% threshold. However, it has proven to be a ‘‘herculean task” to calculate this threshold consistently and correctly.<sup>263</sup> Where parents do not agree, trial judges are forced to choose between requiring the parties to expend significant time and resources proving that the actual time spent with the children by each parent amounts to 40% or risk an appealable error of law by not performing the full analysis.</para>
<para>I do not submit that the 40% threshold should be changed to a different percentage. There were several policy concerns at play when the federal government instituted the 40% threshold, which included protecting the primary caregiver’s economic position, recognizing the direct spending of the other parent, providing an objective method of identification, and minimizing the incentive for opportunistic behaviour by either parent.<sup>264</sup> In choosing 40%, the government chose a fairly strong protection for the primary caregiver’s economic position, more so than with a 30% threshold but less than a 50% threshold. It also recognized the direct spending of the other parent, unlike section 3 which does not account for any spending by the payor parent. Many access parents accrue costs during the child’s time with them, especially as any overnight access involves keeping an adequate home for the children.<sup>265</sup> While</para>

<para>36 CANADIAN FAMILY LAW QUARTERLY [39 C.F.L.Q.]</para>
<para>enumerating 40% as a threshold seems like a bright-line rule compared to a vague standard like ‘‘substantially equal time,”<sup>266</sup> the 40% threshold has proven less predictable in practice because the Guidelines did not specify how time was to be counted to reach this threshold, so there is still much room for disagreement and thus litigation. The cost of uncertainty, however, means that the court has significant discretion to forestall opportunistic behaviour, whereas a bright-line rule might allow parents to act strategically just to cross the threshold.<sup>267</sup></para>
<para>The government chose the ‘‘high threshold” option of 40% for child support under shared parenting and rejected several alternatives found in international approaches, including an automatic reduction, a formulaic approach, a pro-rated set-off, and multipliers.<sup>268</sup> This suggests that in Canada, the government has chosen to prioritize the economic status of the recipient parent at a possible cost to the payor parent and the discretion to ensure a fair quantum of support over the efficiency benefits of a bright-line rule. Still, while I do not propose changing the threshold itself, I submit that this balance could be shifted slightly to bring the law on the books in line with the real-world application of section 9.</para>
<para>A significant problem in applying the threshold test stems from the fact that appellate courts have not resolved whether courts should calculate time by days, overnights, or hours. Appellate courts have clouded the question even further by making such statements as ‘‘[t]here is no universally accepted method for determining the 40%”<sup>269</sup> and the assessment should ‘‘remain flexible . . . [so] the assessment will be more realistic, and more holistic, than a strict mathematical calculation of the time with each parent.”<sup>270</sup> While this strategy does allow the court to better take into account the particular circumstances of each family by considering qualitative as well as quantitative factors, it also creates too much uncertainty which breeds litigation, especially in high-conflict separations. To this end, it would be beneficial for the federal government or an appellate court to either specify a method of counting time or, ideally, perhaps allow the party to meet the 40% threshold when any of these methods of counting time reaches 40%.</para>
<para>When choosing a single unit of measurement, counting by days or overnights has the benefit of being easy to apply, but this cruder measurement makes it easier to meet the 40% threshold; whereas counting by hours has the benefit of finer accuracy, but requires more detailed accounting and thus argument over minute details of the parenting arrangement, which is often not a child-focused approach. The United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand all use overnights</para>
<para><sup>266</sup> The ‘‘substantially equal time” would have allowed more discretion and flexibility to account for each family’s situation, at the cost of the clarity of a bright-line rule. This standard was contemplated and rejected in earlier drafts of section 9.</para>

<para>as the method of counting time.<sup>271</sup> Epstein, on the other hand, supports calculating the time in hours, both when the child is physically under one parent’s control and when the child is under neither parent’s physical control but is one parent’s responsibility, such as during school hours. Epstein finds this method most consistent with the purposes of child support, where the child should benefit from both parents’ ability to support him or her in the same way the child would benefit from the parents’ relative abilities to contribute to their support if the parents had not separated.<sup>272</sup> If a payor parent spends more time with the child without providing care or undertaking responsibility, the child must still look to the recipient for this, so the child support assists the recipient parent in providing that care and undertaking that responsibility.<sup>273</sup></para>
<para>In my opinion, the best solution might be to allow the parent to cross the 40% threshold if they can pass it using any method of calculation (which would likely involve counting days or overnights rather than hours, which requires less evidence). Even though this may appear to protect the economic status of the recipient parent less than the Guidelines intended, this approach is actually in line with the section and the Guidelines as a whole. After all, by not specifying how time is to be counted, the Guidelines allow for any method of calculation to meet the threshold. In addition, if the amount of time each parent spends with the child is close enough to 40% for parents to seriously argue over the issue, perhaps ensuring fair support for the child(ren) actually does require some adjustment to the table amount to ensure both parents are supporting the child to the best of their abilities. This shifts the balance slightly in favour of recognizing the payor parent’s access costs, but without unduly endangering the recipient parent’s economic status. Finally, it is important to remember that 40% is itself an arbitrary amount of time at which to vary child support in the first place.</para>
<para>Furthermore, reducing the conflict at this stage of the inquiry would reduce conflict in the proceedings in general. These benefits outweigh any detriment in making it easier for a parent to cross the 40% threshold, namely the concern that the recipient parent may not receive as much support. However, the stakes of passing the section 9 threshold are low, given the discretion that exists in the remainder of the section to ensure proper support. There is no automatic reduction after crossing the 40% threshold. Therefore, even with the rebuttable presumption of the straight set-off proposed below, any concerns over a ‘‘cliff effect” or any evidence that a party is merely seeking 40% time for the financial benefit rather than actually spending more money on the child could be dealt with using the discretion and flexibility reserved in section 9(b) and section 9(c).</para>

<para>This method would significantly decrease the resources expended by parties and courts in deciding this issue at the beginning of the child support inquiry.</para>
<para>Similarly, in situations where the parties agreed that the 40% threshold was met, I submit that the court should continue to be allowed to accept that conclusion without delving into specific calculations to assure itself the threshold has been met. This aligns with the judicial practice observed in 84% of cases in this survey, where the court accepted the parties’ agreement that the 40% threshold was met, without requiring further evidence. While the court should retain some discretion to analyze the parties’ parenting time despite their agreement if needed,<sup>274</sup> accepting the parties’ agreement on crossing the 40% threshold would be an efficient and beneficial practice because it would minimize conflict between the parties at this stage, minimize cost and time to the parties and the court, and focus the court’s energies on the quantum section 9 factors.</para>
<para><b>(b) Simplifying section 9 application: Utilizing a rebuttable presumption of the straight set-off amount to achieve a fair quantum of support</b></para>
<para>In its 2002 Report to Parliament, the Department of Justice recommended a change to section 9 by using a presumptive set-off formula, but this revision was never made because the Contino decision laid out the proper formula in 2005.<sup>275</sup> Although Contino states that the section 9(a), (b), and (c) considerations are mandatory in any section 9 analysis, most of the cases in this study do not consider all three factors. Often, the parties did not submit the financial disclosure required for the court to consider section 9(b) or (c).<sup>276</sup> Sometimes, the court stated in the decision that it considered all the section 9 factors without providing details about how they were considered or what information the parties provided so that they could be considered.<sup>277</sup> Yet there are several appellate decisions that reverse trial decisions due to incomplete consideration of</para>
<para><sup>274</sup> If the judge has also determined the custody and parenting schedule using the best interests of the children analysis, ordinarily the judge would be able to discern the support obligations that would arise from such a parenting arrangement and be confident that the parenting time sought is not for one parent’s financial benefit. However, in high-conflict cases where self-represented parties may have settled the parenting arrangement but put the support question before the judge for adjudication, there is a concern that one parent may be more sophisticated than the other and manufactured a parenting arrangement with the 40% threshold in mind to reduce their own support obligation. The court’s discretion would only be necessary in rare cases to address a parent’s financial motivation or a serious power imbalance between the parties. Ideally, these issues would have been addressed previously in the parenting issues, but this last-resort discretion would prevent strategic manipulation at the support calculation stage.</para>

This was in F. (G.) v. F. (J.A.C.), where the New Brunswick Court of Appeal overturned the trial court’s decision because ‘‘the mandatory criteria set out in ss. 9 (b) and (c) were not considered and this constitutes an error in law.”<sup>279</sup></para>
<para>Most parties simply cannot afford the time and expense of preparing the necessary financial disclosure required by sections 9(b) and 9(c). If so many cases proceed in this fashion, it seems it is time to recognize that the current framework is too burdensome as applied. This is especially worthy of revision in the family law context where access to justice is already so problematic given the rising number of self-represented litigants, where the stakes are especially high because it is the futures of children that are at stake. As Epstein explains,</para>
<para>Too many cases and too much time is being taken in trying to do the Contino analysis, and if the result is going to be either that the set-off number is the right number, or it is the set-off number plus “a little bit”, we are wasting far too many judicial resources and spending too much money on legal fees to find the right result. I appreciate that dealing with cases of shared custody and split custody can often be enormously difficult, but a Contino analysis does not work for the vast majority of the population, and it is beyond the ability of persons on the Clapham omnibus to do a Contino analysis.<sup>280</sup></para>
<para>This recent survey of cases confirms that Epstein’s concern remains true today, as 85% of cases in this study found that the straight set-off was an appropriate quantum of support. Notably, past surveys similar to this study have shown a trend toward using the straight set-off: from 2006 to 2010, only 45% of cases fixed the quantum of support at the straight set-off, up to 65% of cases from 2012 to 2013, increased to 85% of cases in this study from 2016 to 2017.<sup>281</sup> Where parties can agree on a reasonable quantum of support, they should not be forced to produce additional information at their own expense to provide a proper evidentiary record for the judge so the decision is not at risk of being overturned on appeal.</para>
<para>In light of this fact, I propose that a rebuttable presumption in favour of the set-off amount would be reasonable under a section 9 analysis. It would save time, costs, and confusion for litigants. It would also align with the courts’ current de facto practice without risking appellate intervention for failing to</para>

<para>perform the burdensome three-factor analysis. The court would retain discretion to order parties to produce the budgets and disclosure for a full section 9 analysis if it or either party raised the concern that such disclosure was necessary to ensure a fair amount of support, but it would not be required in straightforward cases where the set-off amount clearly meets the child’s needs (as in 85% of the analyzed cases) and there are not any indicia of a concerning power imbalance between the parties.</para>
<para>Epstein would disagree with my recommendation, as he believes that it is only in rare circumstances that the simple set-off meets the child’s needs.<sup>282</sup> Instead, he has suggested that in his own practice, he splits the difference between the set-off amount and the table amount (although he acknowledges this approach is only for those parties who seek a quick resolution outside of court, as this is not an actual judicial approach), noting that this would achieve the quantum the Supreme Court of Canada ordered in Contino.<sup>283</sup> Despite my respect for Epstein’s opinion, the vast majority of cases in this study (85%) resulted in a straight set-off order, with the court determining that this was an appropriate quantum for support of the child(ren). Furthermore, the cases that varied the set-off are a distinct minority, and of them only 15% of cases actually ordered higher or lower quantums, as the remaining cases had extenuating circumstances that did not decide quantums at all. This revision would merely bring the law on the books in line with the court’s assessment of appropriate quantum of child support in practice.</para>
<para>Any risk from this approach that the straight set-off may not meet the child’s needs is adequately dealt with by reserving discretion to the court to require more evidence in certain cases, and by giving the parties the opportunity to attempt to rebut the presumption if they so choose. With a rebuttable presumption in favour of the set-off, if parties seek to vary the set-off amount or the court requires further evidence to ensure the set-off is fairly meeting the child’s needs based on each parent’s ability to pay, the court would maintain discretion to still require full financial disclosure to perform the Contino analysis under section 9(b) and section 9(c). But the presumption would significantly decrease the number of cases where parties would have to provide such cumbersome evidence. Based on this survey, only approximately 15% of cases would require such disclosure, which would save the parties and especially courts valuable time and costs in the majority of cases.</para>
<para>In particular, I submit that the court should require further disclosure in variation situations where one party<sup>284</sup> objects that the set-off creates a ‘‘cliff</para>

<para>effect” decrease from the higher table support paid prior to variation. Further disclosure may also be required in situations where some of the realities of the parties’ situation are not being addressed by simply looking at their respective incomes and time spent with the child, isolated from the other aspects of the parent’s and child’s circumstances. As recognized by Macdonald and Wilton, some of these realities include when more time spent with the child may not actually increase spending by the parent or significant savings for the other parent (which would suggest a quantum higher than the set-off, closer to the table amount); when a significant disparity of parental incomes exacerbates the differences in standard of living in the two households (which would suggest a higher quantum to provide the child with relatively equal standards of living in both homes); and when shared custody entails more costs in the duplication of services and leaves less money for support (which would suggest the set-off amount or less, depending on the parent’s ability to pay).<sup>285</sup> Judges should also be attuned to situations of power imbalances between parties, especially with self-represented litigants, to ensure that the court does not become complicit in an improper support order based on incomplete or untrue disclosure. By retaining the court’s discretion to require fuller disclosure in certain cases, it minimizes the risk that a presumption in favour of the set-off might result in a quantum that is not in compliance with the Guidelines or the ‘‘reasonable arrangements for the children” requirement for consent orders and agreements under the Divorce Act. It also ensures similar support under provincial legislation for children of unmarried spouses, which promotes the uniformity goal of the Guidelines.</para>
<para>A rebuttable presumption in favour of the set-off would shift the balance of section 9 slightly in favour of efficiency and predictability. With the option for the court to still order production of evidence to vary the set-off based on the factors in section 9(b) and 9(c), this change would not sacrifice the objectives of fairness and flexibility. All of the situations enumerated above could still be adequately dealt with if needed, but the court would not have to waste its resources in the majority of cases where such adjustment was unnecessary. This would create a child-focused approach that also minimizes conflict and increases predictability in child support determinations, with is in line with ensuring fair support for children and access to family justice.</para>
<para><b>(c) Overall goal: Equalize the Net Disposable Incomes (NDI) of each household</b></para>
<para>I propose that a fair preliminary method of determining the straight set-off would be to examine the parties’ net disposable incomes (NDI) to determine the total family income available for child support purposes and determine support with the goal of sharing this NDI equally. Indeed, a 50/50 NDI split is already a core part of the ranges produced by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines.</para>
<para><sup>285</sup> Macdonald &amp; Wilton, supra note 2.</para>
<para>42 CANADIAN FAMILY LAW QUARTERLY [39 C.F.L.Q.]</para>
<para>This aligns with one of the prime goals in Contino that the child(ren)’s standard of living should be approximately equal in both parents’ homes. The NDI calculation would be a useful presumptive tool and act as a simple starting point for adjustment from the set-off in shared parenting cases. If the court were concerned in a particular case that the straight set-off did not meet the child’s need for support, the court would maintain the discretion to seek further disclosure to ensure the child’s needs were being met by the order.<sup>286</sup> Based on the cases in this study, it is expected that the court would only need to delve further into the section 9(b) and 9(c) factors in the minority of cases, when required by the facts of the specific case. I would note that the NDI tool would not be as useful in shared parenting cases where the parties have new spouses or new children since separation, and it would not apply in hybrid cases.</para>
<para><b>(d) Hybrid Arrangements: One approach needed</b></para>
<para>Given the clear division among appellate courts over which method is preferable for calculating support for hybrid parenting arrangements, it would be helpful for the Supreme Court of Canada or the federal government to clarify which approach is appropriate: either the ‘‘economies of scale” approach or the ‘‘two-step” approach, both of which were explained in Part V of this paper. Until one approach is designated as the correct approach, results for similarly-placed children will continue to vary depending on the method chosen by the appellate courts in their province of residence, which undermines the uniformity goal of the Guidelines.</para>
<para>. In my opinion, the ‘‘economies of scale” approach is the better option, because it allows for more flexibility based on the situation of all the children requiring support as a whole, rather than only allowing flexibility in the case of the shared child(ren). Epstein and Thompson also agree that this is the correct approach, as it recognizes the economies of scale in the recipient parent’s home, it acknowledges that full table support under section 3 does not adequately reflect the cost to the payor parent of keeping a home for the shared children, and it accords with the section 9 language where one or both spouses has ‘‘physical custody of, a child for not less than 40 percent of the time over the course of a year.”<sup>287</sup> Macdonald and Wilton specifically note that section 9 is a ‘‘complete regime or system of its own,” where only the listed factors decide the appropriate quantum of support, separate from any presumptions of support in other sections.<sup>288</sup> There is no room for section 3 given the completeness of this regime. Using only section 9 rather than a combination of section 3 and section 9 allows for the fairness and flexibility the government intended for shared</para>
<para><sup>286</sup> As discussed above, this would normally occur where one party objects to the set-off, but the court should have discretion to raise the concern itself in rare or extreme cases where there are indications of a power imbalance or manipulation by one of the parties that undermines the goals of fair support outlined in the legislation.</para>

<para>parenting, which is what the parents are doing even when one child lives primarily with only one of the parents.</para>
<para>The ‘‘two-step” approach creates a fiction that the non-shared child(ren) live completely separate from the child(ren) in the shared parenting situation, which is not a realistic portrayal of a hybrid parenting arrangement home. The table amount for three children is not three times the table amount for one child. While the payor usually pays a higher quantum under section 3 than under section 9, section 9 can adequately deal with any loss compared to the section 3 quantum by considering the recipient parent’s income and by using the economies of scale built into the table amounts and the inherent discretion to achieve a fair outcome. Furthermore, because section 9 is able to take into account the table amount of support owed for the non-shared child anyway, within the section 9(c) inquiry, a fairer quantum will be reached using this method. The shared and not- shared children’s situations are inextricably linked, and the child support calculation under section 9 is better equipped to reach a fair quantum of support based on the actual circumstances of the children than the rigid and presumptive section 3. The ‘‘economies of scale” approach is therefore preferable and correct, given how the table formula is constructed.</para>
<para><b>7. CONCLUSION</b></para>
<para>As society and courts increasingly recognize the benefits a child reaps from maximum contact with both parents, joint and relatively equal parenting is becoming more common. As a result, section 9 of the Guidelines is applied more often than ever. As these 70 cases demonstrate, however, this section is not simple to apply. Throughout this paper, I have suggested areas where Guidelines changes or appellate decisions could clarify and simplify the application of this section. These changes would attempt to increase the predictability and consistency of child support orders in shared parenting arrangements in order to decrease parental conflict and litigation without sacrificing fair and adequate support for the children. These revisions also attempt to increase access to family justice in an era where many family law litigants are self-represented and require clear rules to ensure fair results for their children and themselves upon family breakdown. Such revisions would be in the best interests of courts, parties, and most importantly, the children in shared parenting arrangements.</para>

<para>Bill C-78 makes some relatively modest amendments to the jurisdictional provisions of the Divorce Act, which are established in s. 3 (divorce), s. 4 (corollary relief), and s. 5 (variation of orders for corollary relief), and allowing for transfer of proceedings under s. 6 where a child is most substantially connected to another province. The most significant amendments related to jurisdiction are that:</para>
<para>a) the Federal Court will no longer have jurisdiction over proceedings where spouses commence proceedings on the same date in different provinces, but instead will determine the court of the province that is the ‘‘most appropriate” to hear the matter, based on the habitual residence of any children or the parties’ last common habitual residence;<sup>15</sup> and,</para>
<para>b) the ‘‘most substantially connected” to the child test for establishing or transferring jurisdiction is replaced by a judicial determination of the province that is the child’s ‘‘habitual residence,” or was the child’s last habitual residence before a wrongful removal or retention.<sup>16</sup> The use of the term of ‘‘habitual residence” makes the Divorce Act jurisdictional regime consistent with the concepts in the Hague Conventions on child abduction and child protection.</para>
<para><b>3. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND CONFLICT REDUCTION: DUTIES FOR PARENTS AND LEGAL ADVISERS</b></para>

These are important exhortational statements for parents about the need to focus on the interests of their children and to increase awareness of the harm that children experience when exposed to parental arguments and conflict (let alone violence).<sup>17</sup> Although higher conflict parents are not likely to be directly influenced by this type of legislative statement, lawyers should also be referencing them when advising their clients. Judges may refer to these duties in conferences and judgements to warn parents that their failure to honour the obligations created in these provisions may affect future decisions of the courts.</para>
<para>Section 7.3 establishes a duty, ‘‘to the extent that it is appropriate to do so, [that] the parties to a proceeding shall try to resolve” the matters that may be the subject of an order under the Divorce Act through a ‘‘family dispute resolution process.” The concept of a ‘‘family dispute resolution process” is defined in s. 2 as a ‘‘process outside of court that is used by parties to a family law dispute to attempt to resolve any matters in dispute, including negotiation, mediation and collaborative law” [emphasis added]. Section 7.3 encourages the use of non- litigious dispute resolution, premised on the view that avoiding an adversarial process is likely to promote better co-operation and less conflict between parents, as well as reduce costs for them and society. This provision, however, recognizes that sometimes it is ‘‘appropriate” to use a court-based process, particularly if there are concerns about abuse or family violence, and court protection is needed, or if one party is making unreasonable demands. These provisions are intended to encourage resolution of disputes in a non-adversarial fashion, though it is important to appreciate that many judges who deal with family cases devote considerable time, energy, and skill to family dispute settlement in conferences and interim proceedings. Only a tiny fraction of parenting disputes in Canada are resolved by a judge after a trial. Further, although in some places there are government-subsidized family mediation services, in most places in Canada only the relatively affluent can afford mediation or other non-court services. For many separating parents, family court judges at conferences provide the only ‘‘free” non-litigious dispute resolution service, which may be especially important for self-represented litigants.<sup>18</sup> Further, for some litigants, the authority of the court may add to the effectiveness of judicially-led settlement efforts compared to mediation outside the court process.</para>

However, some litigants need the ‘‘authority of the sash” to meaningfully engage in a mediative process, and the cost of having judges perform these services is ‘‘not visible,” while forsome politicians having publicly funded non-court dispute resolution servives seems like a ‘‘frill” that should not be funded in times of financial exigency.</para>

<para>complete, accurate and up-to-date information if required to do so under this Act.” Rules of procedure in every jurisdiction in Canada have similar provisions, but, like the other duties articulated for parents under Bill C-78, it is helpful, especially for those without legal representation, to provide clarity and reminders.</para>
<para>Section 7.5 states that for ‘‘greater certainty, a person who is subject to an order made under this Act shall comply with the order until it is no longer in effect.” This of course is exactly what the term ‘‘order” means, but family judges not infrequently have to tell parents that a ‘‘court order is not a polite suggestion or an invitation,”<sup>19</sup> so it is useful for the statute to inform parents right from the start, if they read the legislation, about their duty to comply with orders. It seems doubtful, however, that this generally worded provision will alter the ‘‘great caution” that courts exercised when considering contempt motions in family law proceedings for failing to comply with court orders, such as those governing parenting schedules or communication.<sup>20</sup></para>
<para>Subsection 7.7(2) requires ‘‘every legal adviser” to inform all clients in proceedings under the Divorce Act of their ‘‘duties under this Act,” and s. 7.7(3) requires that legal advisers certify that they have done so. Thus, lawyers will be obliged to speak to parents going through a divorce about the parental duties to act in manners consistent with their child’s best interests, protect their children from conflict, and try to resolve issues outside of the court process. This requires family lawyers to be ‘‘child-focused” advocates for their adult clients,<sup>21</sup> not simply taking instructions, but providing advice about parental conduct that may harm children, such as abusive conduct or alienating behaviour. It is conceivable that there could be professional sanctions for lawyers who fail to carry out their duties to properly advise parents. However, it seems more likely in practice that if parents are not properly advised, or fail to heed settlement or child-focused advice of their legal adviser, this will in consequences be in terms of court decisions about parenting or awarding costs against a litigant.</para>
<para>These provisions are intended to remind parents and their professional advisers of the harm to children from exposure to continuing parental conflict and to encourage resolution of disagreements about parenting and economic issues outside of the adversarial process.<sup>22</sup> Bill C-78 also provides in s. 16.1(6) that a court may make an order directing parties to attend an out-of-court</para>

<para><b>4. CONCEPTS: PARENTING PLANS AND PARENTING ORDERS</b></para>
<para>Outside of Canada, many countries have abandoned the antiquated concepts of ‘‘custody” and ‘‘access” that are found in our present Divorce Act.<sup>26</sup> Further, as noted above, provincial legislation in British Columbia, Alberta, and Nova Scotia has already ceased using those concepts, which have their origin in property law and place an emphasis on the protection of parental rights. The concepts in Bill C-78 promote parenting arrangements that are child-focused and premised on the responsibilities of parents rather than their rights. Many separating parents in Canada already make arrangments for some form of co- parenting, such as ‘‘joint legal custody” or ‘‘shared custody.” However, the fact that the 1986 Divorce Act still uses archaic terms that have proprietary connotations is the wrong place to start parents and courts thinking about the process. It leaves the impression that one parent will be the ‘‘winner” of custody, and the other is the ‘‘loser,” afforded only the ‘‘access” rights of a ‘‘visiting parent.” The use of these terms is especially problematic for self-represented individuals who may look to the legislation for guidance, as well as for clients whose professional advisors continue to use such terminology.</para>
<para><sup>23</sup> In most provinces, there are limited restrictions on family ADR; in Quebec, family arbitration is not permitted, and in Ontario there are restrictions on the use of family arbitration.</para>
<para><sup>24</sup> As permitted under Ontario Family Law Rule 17(8)(b)(iii).</para>
<para><sup>25</sup> In British Columbia, the Family Law Act, S.B.C. 2011, c. 25, ss. 8-11 allow for one party to a family case to require the other party to attend and attempt mediation, with some exceptions, for example where family violence is a concern.</para>
<para><sup>26</sup> While orders made after the amendments come into force should use the new terminology, the concept of ‘‘custody” will continue to be significant for proceedings under the Hague Convention on Child Abduction. Article 5 of the Convention provides that for the purposes of proceedings under the Convention, the ‘‘rights of custody” include ‘‘rights relating to the care of the person of the child and, in particular, the right to determine the child’s place of residence.” Under Bill C-78, in the absence of an agreement or court order to the contrary, a child cannot be relocated without a court order, in effect providing that both parents have a continuing right to determine the child’s residence, and ‘‘rights of custody” for proceedings under that the Convention.</para>
<para>52 CANADIAN FAMILY LAW QUARTERLY [39 C.F.L.Q.]</para>
<para>In his October 2018 decision, not long after the introduction of Bill C-78 in Parliament, an Ontario Superior Court judge, McDermot J., made comments supportive of the new terminology:<sup>27</sup></para>
<para>The legal term, “custody” in family matters is close to having had its day. For years now, there have been efforts by legislators to rid statutes of that term, the latest of which are the proposed amendments to the Divorce Act which suggest exactly that. There is good reason for this; the term “custody” as it relates to children arises, from the 19th century and implies ownership of children which is, of course, not what any contemporary court order intends. It is also pejorative; the person who has custody feels as though they have “won” something, and the person without custody feels a loss and exclusion. The term is, in itself, the source of much litigation and gets in the way of settlement because of the emotional power behind the language.</para>
<para>These comments were obiter dicta, but reflect the judicial support for these reforms. On the the specific facts of Van v. Palombi, which involved a very high conflict situation, McDermot J. drastically restricted the role of the father in the lives of his children. The father had inappropriately involved the children in the litigation, defied court-ordered terms regarding visitation and communication, and refused to acknowledge the effect of his conduct on the children or his former wife,. The court ordered ‘‘sole custody” to the mother and a suspension of ‘‘access” to the father until he completed counselling. In such exteme cases, exclusive parenting arrangements will continue to be appropriate and possible under the Divorce Act reforms, albeit using different terminology.</para>
<para>Under Bill C-78, courts are to make ‘‘parenting orders” that allocate or schedule ‘‘parenting time,” and that allocate or share ‘‘decision-making responsibility.”<sup>28</sup> Parents are encouraged to make their own arrangements outside the court process ‘‘to the extent that it is appropriate”<sup>29</sup> and to agree to a ‘‘parenting plan” that addresses issues related to the care the child, including parenting time and decision-making. There is a broad definition of the concept of a ‘‘parenting plan” in s. 16.6(2), which provides that it ‘‘means a document or part of a document that contains the elements relating to parenting time, decision-making responsibility or contact to [non-parents like a grandparent] which the parties agree.” It may be a separate document that deals only with</para>

This was clearly obiter dicta, and consistent with the prior Ontario Court of Appeal decision in M. v. F., 2015 ONCA 277, 2015 CarswellOnt 5630 (Ont. C.A.). It was a significant judicial endorsement of reform, in part because such judicial comments about matters that are before Parliament are not common, and typically only made if there is already a wide-spread view that such reform is needed.</para>

<para>The federal government already has materials available on the internet to assist parents making a parenting plan.<sup>30</sup> These materials will be updated by the Department before the new law comes into force. The Ontario Chapter of the Association of Family and Conciliation Courts has also prepared a Parenting Plan Guide and a Parenting Plan Template to assist parents and professionals making these plans.<sup>31</sup></para>
<para>Parenting plans are normally developed on a consensual basis, either by the parents themselves or with assistance of professionals like mediators or lawyers. Children may have a role in the development of a plan, though they are not parties to any plan or agreement. Bill C-78 provides that a court granting a divorce ‘‘shall” incorporate a parenting plan that the parents have agreed to, unless, in the opinion of the court, it is ‘‘not in the best interests of the child to do so, in which case the court may make any modifications to the plan that it considers appropriate and include it in the order.”<sup>32</sup></para>
<para>The concept of a ‘‘parenting plan” suggests that it will be a ‘‘living document” that may provide for revision as the children grow older and circumstances change, and there may be possibilities for ‘‘trying out” an arrangement for a period of time to see how it works, and then changing it if appropriate.<sup>33</sup> Bill C-78 allows for a court-ordered variation of a parenting order if there is a ‘‘change in circumstances.” If a parenting plan becomes incorporated in an order, the court order can also provide for ‘‘review” under the new s. 16.1(5), without requiring proof of a change in circumstances. In practice, once an initial order is made incorporating a parenting plan, many parents will modify some of the details of the plan, or change its implementation, without returning to court, though if issues of enforcement arise, only a court-endorsed modification can be enforced.</para>
<para>Courts may also include in parenting orders provisions that specify how communication between the parents or between a parent and child is to occur or that prohibit relocation of a child without a court order or the consent of both parents.<sup>34</sup> Such terms are often included in parenting plans.</para>

<para>Parenting plans may, however, also have provisions that a court will be reluctant to incorporate into a court order, such as some detailed rules about parental conduct, for example, about how to introduce new partners to children, or statements of principle that be useful but very vague, such as the requirement that parents treat one another in a ‘‘friendly, respectful way.” It may be helpful for parents to have such provisions in their plans, even if not legally enforceable, as just discussing them and undertaking a moral commitment to honour them has value.</para>
<para>A parenting plan may be a distinct document, or can be incorporated into a larger Separation Agreement or Court Order that deals with other issues, in particular property and support issues. There is value in having a parenting plan as a separate document as it emphasizes to parents that issues related to their children are separate from their other economic and legal affairs, and this will also facilitate the almost inevitable review of provisions of the plan as children grow older and circumstances change. The nature of the matters to be resolved by the parents, the nature of the parents’ relationship, the stage of the separation process and the role of the family justice professional (e.g. judge, lawyer, or mental health professional) will all influence whether the plan is in a separate document.</para>
<para>Lawyers should consider having the parenting plan as an appendix to a Separation Agreement, with a stipulation that parents may review and amend the plan without affecting the validity of the Separation Agreement. This may encourage timely, child-focused reviews.</para>
<para>The advantage of incorporating a parenting plan into a court order is that it may encourage compliance, as, if necessary, court processes can be used to enforce the plan, or at least major provisions. One of the challenges of incorporation is that a judge may be reluctant to do this if the agreement has provisions that are vague or aspirational. Further, review of the plan will be more expensive and complex if it is expected that the court order will be amended. A plan that is detailed, or has provisions that mention times or places, or has other specific provisions, is almost certain to need to be reviewed as the circumstances of parents and children change.</para>
<para><b>(a) Decision-making</b></para>
<para>Bill C-78 allows a parenting plan or order to ‘‘allocate” or provide for a ‘‘sharing” of parental decision-making. In cases where parents can co-operate and communicate reasonably well, shared decision-making is most likely to help children feel that both parents are fully involved in their lives. However, if parents have difficulty with co-operation and communication, it may be advisable to have a dispute resolution provision, such as referral to mediation, if the parents are likely to be able to access a mediator and compromise. Otherwise, if conflict is higher, it is likely preferable to allocate decision-making for major issues to one parent, with an obligation to consult with the other parent before and communicate after decisions with the other parent. Giving one</para>
<para>BILL C-78: THE 2020 REFORMS TO CANADA’S DIVORCE ACT 55</para>
<para>parent the final authority to make a decision limits the potential of resorting to the courts to resolve disagreements. In these higher conflict cases, one parent can be responsible for all major decisions, or there may be a division, for example with one parent having responsibility for decision-making about schools and education after consultation with the other parent, and the other parent being responsible for another sphere of decision-making, like religious instruction and observance.</para>
<para>‘‘Parental decision-making responsibility” is defined in s. 2(1) to mean the responsibility for making ‘‘significant decisions about a child’s well-being, including in respect of: health; education; culture, language, religion and spirituality; and significant extra-curricular activities.” This includes decisions about major issues that have continuing effects and that very likely will need to be implemented by both parents, such as about what school the child will attend. Unless a court order or parenting agreement specifies otherwise, under s. 16.2(2) a person with parenting time has the ‘‘exclusive authority to make, during that time, day-to-day decisions affecting the child.” Day-to-day decisions, also not explicitly defined in the Act, but by implication refer to matters that one parent can implement on their own, such as issues related to a child’s meals and bedtimes.<sup>35</sup> It will be useful for the order or agreement to specify which areas of decision-making are to be allocated or shared, as the effect of s. 16.2(2) may be to make the ‘‘default” that the parent with care may make decisions that can be implemented in that time. For example, decisions about extra-curricular activities are significant for many children, especially those of school-age or adolescents, if not a specified issue of decision-making, whichever parent has care of a child at a particular time may assert the sole right to decide whether the child will participate in an activity at that time, claiming that this is a ‘‘day-to-day” decision. It is, however, preferable for a child to engage in extra-curricular activities that both parents support and that the child can undertake while in the care of each parent.</para>
<para>Bill C-78 also provides that any person who has any parenting time or decision-making responsibility is entitled to request information about the child from the other parent, and from third parties, such as schools and doctors, unless the court orders otherwise, even if that parent has no responibility for decision- making about that aspect of the child’s life.<sup>36</sup></para>

Today in Canada, while about two-thirds of children whose parents divorce have some form of joint custody, most of them continue to have a ‘‘primary residence” with one parent (usually the mother) and only a quarter of children of separated parents have ‘‘equal shared custody” (40 to 60% of time with each parent).<sup>41</sup></para>

Even in families where both parents were fully employed in paid jobs, fathers in 2015 spent significantly less time on child care than mothers (104 minutes a day versus 143 minutes), though when both parents are employed fathers do more of some household tasks, notably outdoor work and home maintenance. Of course in some families (about 10%), both intact and separated, fathers spend significantly more time on child care than mothers.</para>
<para>BILL C-78: THE 2020 REFORMS TO CANADA’S DIVORCE ACT 57</para>
<para>A number of research studies from different countries have found that children generally have better outcomes if they are in joint care arrangements that involve significant time with each parent rather than in the sole custody of one parent.<sup>42</sup> However, it is critical to appreciate that these studies are largely based on the experiences of families where the parents have agreed to some form of shared custody, not cases where it is imposed by a court. In other words, there is a correlation between children spending roughly equal time with both parents and positive outcomes for children, but it is not established that this is a causal relationship.</para>
<para>Although children in general benefit from significant involvement of both parents in their lives, frequent contact with both parents is most beneficial when conflict is low but can have adverse effects if conflict is high, especially if it is prolonged past the immediate post-separation period.<sup>43</sup> Further, research suggests that equal shared custody generally only benefits a child if there was already substantially equal sharing of parenting before separation.<sup>44</sup> Court- imposed ‘‘equal parenting” can be especially stressful for children whose parents have a high conflict separation and are having difficulty co-operating.<sup>45</sup> Experience in jurisdictions that have tried various forms of statutory presumptions about parenting time reveals that such legislative rules tend to promote litigation, especially among high conflict parents, who are not well- suited to this type of arrangement.<sup>46</sup></para>

<para>As discussed further below, Bill C-78 provides some important guidance for the making of parenting orders, schedules, and plans. The Bill wisely follows the approach of provincial reforms and avoids broad statutory presumptions about time-sharing or decision-making.<sup>47</sup> However, while the term is not explicitly used, it is submitted that the Divorce Act amendments encourage various forms of co-parenting,<sup>48</sup> a broad social concept used by social scientists, family justice professionals, and parents in many countries, premised on both parents being significantly involved in the care of children and co-operatively sharing decision- making. Co-parenting is clearly different from the traditional model of sole custody to one parent and access to the other.<sup>49</sup> Co-parenting includes but is not limited to equal parenting time and fully shared decision-making for all issues.

<para><sup>48</sup> The term ‘‘shared parenting” is also widely used by social scientists to describe arrangements where both parents have significant involvement (at least 25% of the time) and there is shared parental decision-making. The term may be useful for some parents, as it gives an important message about shared rights and responsibilities, but lawyers and judges in Canada may want to be cautious about its use. Under the present version of the Child Support Guidelines, s. 9, the term ‘‘shared custody” is used for cases where each parent has the child at least 40% of the time. The terminology in the Guidelines will be changed when Bill C-78 comes into force, likely using the term ‘‘shared parenting time” for cases where s. 9 applies and each parent has the child at least 40% of the time. The term ‘‘shared parenting” is already often used to refer to cases where s. 9 applies. For a discussion of the range of definitions and use of ‘‘shared parenting”, see Marsha Kline Pruett &amp; J.

<para>The abandonment of the archaic concepts of “custody” and “access” is welcome and consistent with developments in many other countries. The concepts of “parenting time,” “parental decision-making,” and “parenting plans” are more nuanced, and their adoption will generally help parents to make more child-focused parenting arrangements. However, for the highest conflict cases, those most likely to be resolved by judges, using these concepts requires more detailed orders than simply making an award for custody. Judges and lawyers already often need to make detailed orders and agreements for these high conflict cases, and are aware of potential issues of variation and enforcement. The ongoing challenges of high conflict cases will continue under the new law.</para>

<para><b>5. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD</b></para>
<para>The present Divorce Act requires that decisions about custody and access are to consider only the ‘‘best interests of the child,” though the Act presently does not specify what this entails. Broadly consistent with the provisions of most provincial legislation, Bill C-78 sets out a non-exhaustive list of factors that are to be considered in making a parenting order or other ‘‘best interests” decision:</para>
<para>Factors to be considered</para>
<para>16(3) In determining the best interests of the child, the court shall consider all factors related to the circumstances of the child, including</para>
<para>(a) the child’s needs, given the child’s age and stage of develop- ment, such as the child’s need for stability;</para>
<para>(b) the nature and strength of the child’s relationship with each spouse, each of the child’s siblings and grandparents and any other person who plays an important role in the child’s life;</para>
<para>(c) each spouse’s willingness to support the development and maintenance of the child’s relationship with the other spouse;</para>
<para>(d) the history of care of the child;</para>
<para>(e) the child’s views and preferences, by giving due weight to the child’s age and maturity, unless they cannot be ascertained;</para>
<para>(f) the child’s cultural, linguistic, religious and spiritual upbring- ing and heritage, including Indigenous upbringing and heritage;</para>
<para>(g) any plans for the child’s care;</para>
<para>(h) the ability and willingness of each person in respect of whom the order would apply to care for and meet the needs of the child;</para>
<para>(i) the ability and willingness of each person in respect of whom the order would apply to communicate and cooperate, in particular with one another, on matters affecting the child;</para>
<para>(j) any family violence and its impact on, among other things,</para>
<para>(i) the ability and willingness of any person who engaged in the family violence to care for and meet the needs of the child, and</para>
<para>(ii) the appropriateness of making an order that would require persons in respect of whom the order would apply to cooperate on issues affecting the child; and</para>
<para>(k) any civil or criminal proceeding, order, condition, or measure that is relevant to the safety, security and well-being of the child.</para>
<para>Although the list in the new s. 16(3) is non-exhaustive and does not establish priorities amoung the factors listed, in making decisions about a child’s best interests, s. 16(2) specifies that ‘‘the court shall give primary consideration to the</para>
<para>BILL C-78: THE 2020 REFORMS TO CANADA’S DIVORCE ACT 61</para>
<para>child’s physical, emotional and psychological safety, security and well-being” [emphasis added]. This subsection establishes that concerns about family violence should generally be given priority. However s. 16(3) also allows consideration of such factors as the emotional well-being of a child by not being unjustifiably alienated from a parent might be a ‘‘primary consideration.”</para>
<para><b>(a) Family Violence</b></para>
<para>Although most provincial and territorial legislation governing post- separation parenting recognizes the significant negative impacts of spousal violence for children, the present Divorce Act makes no mention of family violence. Consistent with the growing awareness of the effects of intimate partner violence, not only on the direct victim but also on children who are exposed to this violence, Bill C-78 has a number of procedural and substantive provisions related to ‘‘family violence.”<sup>53</sup> The concept of ‘‘family violence” is broadly defined in the new s. 2 to include acts directed at a child or other family members, including physical abuse, sexual abuse, threats of harm, harassment, psychological abuse, and financial abuse. Family violence is also defined to include intentional harm to pets or destruction of property, such as breaking furniture or plates.</para>
<para>Section 7.8 requires judges dealing with Divorce Act proceedings to make inquiries about other proceedings that may involve the parties that are related to family violence or child abuse, in particular civil, child protection or criminal proceedings. Provincial and territorial authorities will need to ensure that court forms require parties to provide this information to the court and should be exploring how to improve information sharing between courts to allow judges making decisions under the Divorce Act, especially about children and victims of family violence, to have access to information about other family violence proceedings.<sup>54</sup></para>
<para>As noted above, s. 16(3) sets out a non-exhaustive list of factors to be taken into account in determining a child’s best interests in making a parenting order or contact order, a list which includes ‘‘family violence.” Paragragh 16(3)(j) requires courts to consider the impact of family violence on the ‘‘ability” of a parent to meet the needs of the child and the effects of family violence on ‘‘the appropriateness of making an order that would require” the parents ‘‘to cooperate on issues affecting the child.” Further s. 16(2) specifies that ‘‘the court shall give primary consideration to the child’s physical, emotional and psychological safety, security and well-being” [emphasis added].</para>

<para>These provisions are clearly intended both to protect children from direct harm and to ensure that victims of intimate partner violence are not coerced into on-going abusive relationships with a former partner as a result of parenting arrangements. However, Bill C-78 recognizes that family violence is multifaceted, requiring a court to consider not only the ‘‘impact of family violence,” including its seriousness and recency, but also whether it involved isolated incidents or a pattern of ‘‘coercive and controlling behaviour.” Further, courts are required to take account of any steps taken by the perpetrator to prevent further family violence and improve their ability to care for the child.<sup>55</sup> Bill C-78 reflects an awareness that family violence is a complex and often evolving issue and effectively encourages both victims and perpetrators to seek appropriate assistance to address issues of family violence.<sup>56</sup></para>
<para>In Canada, many family justice professionals who engage in collaborative and mediation processes are already aware of the need to screen for domestic violence and other power imbalances.<sup>57</sup> However, the enactment of Bill C-78 will serve as an important reminder to all professionals involved in the family justice process of the importance of family violence as a factor in making parenting arrangements. Further, the Bill will help inform those who are self-represented and may not appreciate the significance of harmful effects of family violence on children. The Department of Justice is preparing new materials to educate and assist lawyers in screening for family violence, as well as providing more information for victims of family violence.<sup>58</sup></para>
<para>As advocates for abused women like the National Association of Women and the Law pointed out at the Parliamentary hearings, the encouragement in the Divorce Act amendments to resolve cases outside of the court process could result in victims of family violence accepting unfair settlements or being placed in dangerous situations.<sup>59</sup> These are important concerns, and implementation must be undertaken in a way that ensures the protection for victims of family violence.</para>

<para><b>(b) Views of the Child</b></para>
<para>Although not mentioned as a factor in the present Divorce Act, there is growing appreciation of the importance of taking account of the perspectives and preferences of children who are the subject of parental disputes, as this promotes better outcomes for children, respects their rights, and often facilitates settlement.<sup>60</sup> Bill C-78 makes the Divorce Act consistent with Article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which Canada is a signatory, and with provincial family legislation in Canada, requiring consideration of the child’s views as a best interests factor.</para>
<para>The new s. 16(3)(e) specifies that in making a parenting plan or court order, parents, professionals, and the courts ‘‘shall” consider ‘‘the child’s views and preferences, by giving due weight to the child’s age and maturity, unless they cannot be ascertained.” This provision establishes an obligation on both the court making a parenting decision and the parties presenting a case to make reasonable efforts to ‘‘ascertain” the views and preferences of children. While children should be consulted, and their views sought, there must be a careful balance so that children are not inappropriately drawn into parental disputes or pressured to ‘‘take sides.”</para>
<para>In cases that are going through the courts, testimony from parents about what their child told is likely to be heavily discounted unless supported by independent evidence.<sup>61</sup> A Views of the Child Report,<sup>62</sup> a report of an assessment by the mental health professional, or appointment of counsel for a child may be considered as a means of ascertaining the perspectives of children and presenting this evidence to the court. Children in Québec often meet with judges who are dealing with their parents’ disputes.<sup>63</sup> Judicial meetings with children have been less common elsewhere in Canada. Although there are limitations to what can be learned by a judge at a single, relatively short meeting, children often appreciate and benefit from meeting with the judge. Further, the judge may gain valuable insights from such a meeting and the practice of judicial interviewing of children</para>

<para>64 CANADIAN FAMILY LAW QUARTERLY [39 C.F.L.Q.]</para>
<para>is becoming more common in Canada.<sup>64</sup> Since Bill C-78 imposes a positive obligation on courts to ascertain the views of children, it is likely to encourage more use of judicial interviewing, especially in cases where resources to prepare a report are limited.</para>
<para>An important responsibility for professionals involved in collaborative processes, mediation, and other non-court family dispute resolution processes is to consider how to involve children.<sup>65</sup> In some mediation cases, this may involve a mediator interviewing a child, having a Views of the Child report prepared by a mental health professional, or bringing older children into mediation meetings with the parents. In other mediation cases, for example with pre-school age children or parents who are not in conflict over the children, it may be appropriate for parents to simply report on their conversations with their children to the mediator.</para>

<para>While all the factors in s. 16(3) are reflected in case law under the present Divorce Act, and are broadly similar to the non-exhaustive lists in provincial statutes, an interesting addition is s. 16(3)(f) which refers to not just culture, language and religion, but also specifically mentions ‘‘Indigenous upbringing and heritage.” Unlike provincial child welfare statutes, which generally give some priority to Indigenious placements for a child, Bill C-78 does not give this factor greater weight. Indeed, while most ‘‘best interests” defintions in Canadian legislation make some reference to the importance of religion, culture, language and heritage, case law makes clear that judges are also expected to avoid giving preference to one parent’s heritage over the other.<sup>66</sup> If parents have a different cultural, ethnic, or linguist heritage, it seems likely s. 16(3)(f) will primarily serve to reinforce the importance for children of having regular involvement with both</para>

<para>16(10) Maximum Contact</para>
<para>In making an order under this section, the court shall give effect to the principle that a child of the marriage should have as much contact with each spouse as is consistent with the best interests of the child and, for that purpose, shall take into consideration the willingness of the person for whom custody is sought to facilitate such contact.</para>
<para>In interpreting the present s. 16(10), Justice MacLachlin in 1993 in Young v. Young referred to the concept of ‘‘maximum contact”:<sup>69</sup></para>

<para><sup>68</sup> Marginal notes are ‘‘the short notations appearing above or beside each section [. . .] of an Act or Regulation” (Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes, 6th ed., 2014, §14.59). These notes are intended to help readers identify pertinent provisions in the legislation. The name comes from the fact that they originally appeared in the margins of legislation next to the relevant provisions. Despite appearing in a statute, technically the marginal notes are not actually part of the legislation. However, as Ruth Sullivan observes, they are often influential:</para>
<para>‘‘Although technically marginal notes are not considered part of legislation, in fact they are physically present and may well constitute the most frequently read component of many Acts and regulations. To ignore whatever light they shed on the meaning of legislation seems artificial and appropriate.” (§14.60)</para>
<para>There are cases in which marginal notes have been used for legislative interpretation (e.g. R. v. H. (A.D.), 2013 SCC 28, 2013 CarswellSask 304, 2013 CarswellSask 305 (S.C.C.)) though this is not uniformly the case. For example, in Imperial Oil Ltd. v. R., Inco Ltd. v. Canada, 2006 SCC 46, 2006 CarswellNat 3176, 2006 CarswellNat 3177 (S.C.C.), the Supreme Court says (at para. 57) ‘‘although marginal notes are not entirely devoid of usefulness, their value is limited for a court that must address a serious problem of statutory interpretation.” The Supreme Court in Young v. Young, 1993 CarswellBC 264, 1993 CarswellBC 1269, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 3 (S.C.C.) and many later appeal and trial court decisions in family cases have made extensive use of the concept of ‘‘maximum contact.”</para>
<para>As Sullivan observes, the marginal notes appear in Bills and Acts and are drafted by Legislative Counsel of the Department of Justice, but technically are not enacted as part of the legislation. While in practice alteration of a marginal note generally only occurs if Parliament amends the wording of a provision, for Bill C-78 there can be a change in its marginal note by the administrative direction of the Minister of Justice before final official ublication of the Act in the Consolidated Statutes</para>

<para>s. 16(10) . . .is significant. It stands as the only specific factor which Parliament has seen fit to single out as being something which the judge must consider. By mentioning this factor, Parliament has expressed its opinion that contact with each parent is valuable, and that the judge should ensure that this contact is maximized. The modifying phrase “as is consistent with the best interests of the child” means that the goal of maximum contact of each parent with the child is not absolute. To the extent that contact conflicts with the best interests of the child, it may be restricted. But only to that extent. Parliament’s decision to maintain maximum contact between the child and both parents is amply supported by the literature, which suggests that children benefit from continued access. [Emphasis added].</para>
<para>Bill C-78 has provisions that are quite similar to the old s. 16(10). The new s. 16(6) specifies that in ‘‘allocating parenting time, the court shall give effect to the principle that a child should have as much time with each spouse as is consistent with the best interests of the child.” As recognized by the Supreme Court in Young, it is normally in the best interests of children to have significant involvement with both of their parents, absent concerns about safety or a risk to the child’s well-being, but it is clear that this provision is not intended to establish a presumption of equal parenting time.</para>
<para>As drafted and enacted by Parliament, Bill C-78 had a marginal note to s. 16(6) that referred to this as the ‘‘Maximum Parenting Time” provision. This was an adaption of the marginal note of ‘‘Maximum Contact” for the old s. 16(10), but was clearly an inaccurate and potentially misleading notation for the new provision. Maximum time for each parent might suggest a presumption that each parent should have equal parenting time.<sup>70</sup> At the Senate hearings on Bill C-78, serious concerns were raised about the ‘‘Maximum Parenting Time” marginal note, and the Minister of Justice responded by announcing that the marginal note to s. 16(6) would be revised to read ‘‘Parenting time consistent with the best interests of child,” which much more closely reflects the legislative intent behind this provision and makes clear that there are no presumptions about parenting time.<sup>71</sup> This marginal note, ‘‘Parenting time consistent with the best interests of child” now appears in Statutory Consolidation of the Divorce Act on the official Department of Justice website.<sup>72</sup></para>
<para><sup>70</sup> In Arizona, A.R.S. §25-403.02 provides: ‘‘the court shall adopt a parenting plan that provides for both parents to share legal decision-making regarding their child and that maximizes their respective parenting time.” In Re Marriage of Barron and Barron, Ariz C.A., 1st Div. 2018, the Arizona Court of Appeals held that this legislation makes ‘‘equal parenting time” that ‘‘starting spot” for any judicially imposed parenting plan.</para>

<para>The second part of the present s. 16(10), sometimes called the ‘‘friendly parent” provision, is reflected in the new s. 16(3)(i), which states that one of the factors in deciding on the best interests of the child is the ‘‘ability and willingness” of each parent ‘‘to communicate and cooperate, in particular with one another, on matters affecting the child.” It is, however, important to note that s. 16(3)(i) is limited by s. 16.2 which states that the ‘‘primary” best interests consideration is the protection of the ‘‘safety” and well-being of the child.</para>
<para>Although it is clear that the present Divorce Act does not create any ‘‘presumptions”, many cases cite the short marginal note or concept ‘‘maximum contact” to justify at least some contact with a parent whom a child may be reluctant to see,<sup>73</sup> or to justify shared custody or equal parenting time despite parental conflict.<sup>74</sup> It is submitted that, despite the disappearance of the word ‘‘maximum” from the marginal notes, since the words of the legislation have not changed materially, and the social science literature continues to recognize the value, in most cases, of significant involvement of both parents in the lives of their children after separation, Canadian courts should continue to rely on the precedents under the previous law. Subsection 16(6) and s. 16(3)(i) continue to inform parents, their professional advisers, and the courts that it is generally in the interests of the child’s emotional and social development to have significant continuing relationships with both parents. This is a reminder that parents should not be undermining the child’s relationship with the other parent or engaging in ‘‘alienating parental behaviours.”<sup>75</sup> These provisions are consistent with the changes in terminology and concepts, though Bill C-78 also recognizes that in some cases, in particular where there are concerns about family violence or significant parental mental health issues, contact with a parent may need to be restricted or even suspended.</para>
<para>The combined effect of these provisions is to encourage co-parenting, without creating a legal presumption in favour of any particular regime of parenting time or decision-making. In particular, Bill C-78 also recognizes co-</para>

<para>parenting is not appropriate if such an arrangement poses a risk to the safety or well-being of a child.</para>
<para>As with the changes in terminology, these provisions contribute to ‘‘changing the culture” of professionals and parents about the divorce process. These provisions also affect the courts. Parents who are found to be promoting conflict or undermining their children’s relationship with the other parent may see judges limiting their time with their children. Lawyers should be advising clients to reduce conflict and warning them that angry texts and emails to the other parent may be ‘‘used against” them in later proceedings.</para>
<para><b>(e) Court-Ordered Social and Mental Health Services</b></para>
<para>Section 16.1(6) allows a court to ‘‘direct the parties to attend a family dispute resolution process,” subject to provincial law. As noted above, in cases that are in the early stages of litigation, this is most commonly likely to be a referral to a parenting education program or mediation services. An important form of response in higher conflict separations that have proceeded to litigation is the possibility of a court order requiring both parents, and often their children as well, to attend counselling services to help them gain a better understanding of their relationship problems, improve communications between the parents, and promote compliance with parenting plans and orders. These services may be especially useful for cases involving problems where children are resisting contact with one parent (which may be alienation or estrangement).<sup>76</sup></para>
<para>The best approaches to ensuring the continued involvement of both parents in their children’s lives in high conflict cases often require collaboration between courts and counselling or social service providers. Court orders to direct attendance of parents and children at counselling services can be an effective response to high conflict cases.<sup>77</sup> Judges may need to receive reports on whether parents are attending and meaningfully engaging in counselling, as this can be critical for ensuring effective responses to some high conflict cases. There has, however, been controversy, especially in Ontario, about the jurisdiction of courts to order counselling under the Divorce Act without the consent of all involved.<sup>78</sup></para>
<para><sup>76</sup> See e.g. Bala &amp; Hebert, ‘‘Children Resisting Contract: What’s a Lawyer to Do?” (2016) 36 Can Fam L Q 1, for a discussion of interventions and strategies to help reduce conflict and promote the interests of children.</para>

Huver, 2018 ONSC 2322, 2018 CarswellOnt 8757, 9 R.F.L. (8th) 244 (Ont.

<para>BILL C-78: THE 2020 REFORMS TO CANADA’S DIVORCE ACT 69</para>
<para>In its 2019 decision in A.M. v. C.H., the Ontario Court of Appeal accepted that courts have the authority to make these orders for counselling for all family members as a response to children resisting contact with a parent.<sup>79</sup> Court- mandated use of counselling services aimed at improving communications and relationships can be an important tool in cases of high conflict separation, even without all invoved consenting to the order. However, without some willingness of all concerned to co-operate, an order for counselling cannot be effective. The coming into force of s. 7.2 and s. 16.1(6) of Bill C-78 reinforces the approach of the Court of Appeal, that in appropriate cases courts can make orders for counselling, with the potential consequences of a failure to meaningfully engage in counselling being a court-ordered change in parenting arrangements.<sup>80</sup></para>
<para><b>6. RELOCATION</b></para>
<para>Perhaps the most significant changes in Bill C-78 to the substantive law governing post-divorce parenting are the provisions that deal with parental relocation (also known as ‘‘mobility” cases). The present Divorce Act has no provisions governing relocation, and the 1996 Supreme Court of Canada decision in Gordon v. Goertz<sup>81</sup> established a highly discretionary ‘‘best interests of the child” test for making decisions about relocation. That decision gives little real direction, and the uncertainty about how courts will resolve these disputes has resulted in frequent litigation about relocation. Further, the fact that courts may give little weight to a non-relocation term in an agreement may have undermined reliance on parenting plans, and may have made their negotiation more difficult.<sup>82</sup></para>
<para>Bill C-78 establishes a detailed procedural and substantive regime to govern relocation cases.<sup>83</sup> A parent who has rights or responsibilities under the Divorce Act will be required to give some notice to the other parent of any change in residence.<sup>84</sup> Further, a parent who intends to relocate must give at least 60 days</para>

<para>A person intending to ‘‘relocate” may make an ex parte application to the court to be relieved of the obligation to give notice, in particular if there is a ‘‘risk of family violence.”<sup>87</sup></para>
<para>A parent who receives a notice of intention of the other parent to relocate with the child will have 30 days to serve a written notice of objection on the parent proposing to relocate or to make an application to the court objecting to the relocation of the child. If a notice of objection is served on the parent seeking to relocate with the child, that person is obliged to seek court approval for the move. If no notice is served and no application of objection is filed to commence proceedings about this issue, and there is no previous order prohibiting relocation, the party intending to relocate with the child may do so.</para>
<para>If an application to decide relocation comes before the court, the judge shall make a decision based on an assessment of the ‘‘best interests” of the child. In addition to the best interests factors in s. 16 discussed above, the new s. 16.92(1) provides that in deciding whether to authorize a relocation of a child of the marriage, the court shall, in order to determine what is in the best interests of the child, take into consideration:</para>
<para>(a) the reasons for the relocation;</para>
<para>(b) the impact of the relocation on the child;</para>
<para>(c) the amount of time spent with the child by each person who has parenting time or a pending application for a parenting order and the level of involvement in the child’s life of each of those persons;</para>
<para>(d) whether the person who intends to relocate the child complied with any applicable notice requirement under section 16.9, provincial family law legislation, an order, arbitral award, or agreement;</para>
<para>(e) the existence of an order, arbitral award, or agreement that specifies the geographic area in which the child is to reside;</para>

<para><sup>85</sup> Section 16.9. Although in theory both parents are required to give notice of a planned relocation, in practice this will only be a legal issue if a parent want to ‘‘relocate the child.” There is no remedy if a parent relocates without a child.</para>

<para>(g) whether each person who has parenting time or decision-making responsibility or a pending application for a parenting order has complied with their obligations under family law legislation, an order, arbitral award, or agreement, and the likelihood of future compliance.</para>
<para>This list largely reflects relocation jurisprudence under the Diovrce Act, though it is notable that provision of an order or agreement restriciting relocation is now clearly a factor to be considered.<sup>88</sup> The new s. 16.92(2) clarifies that the court dealing with a relocation application is not to consider whether the parent seeking to relocate would relocate without the child, effectively preventing the asking of the ‘‘double bind” question; this is largely consistent with previous case law in many provinces.<sup>89</sup> Bill C-78 does, however, reverse Gordon v. Goertz to the extent that the reasons for relocation will be a factor to consider.<sup>90</sup> This is a welcome reform and is consistent with most relocation case law, which effectively ignored the Supreme Court’s obiter statement on not considering the reasons for the move.</para>
<para>Most significantly, the new s. 16.93 establishes burdens of proof to apply to relocation cases:</para>
<para>. If the parties have ‘‘substantially equal time” with the child, the party seeking to relocate with the child will have the burden of establishing that the relocation of the child is in the best interests of the child.<sup>91</sup></para>
<para>. If the relocating party has the child for ‘‘the vast majority of . . . time,”<sup>92</sup> the onus of establishing that the relocation is not in the best interests of the child will be on the objecting party.</para>
<para><sup>88</sup> See e.g. Ligate v. Richardson, 1997 CarswellOnt 2185, 34 O.R. (3d) 423 (Ont. C.A.) which held that such clauses should be given little or no weight.</para>
<para><sup>89</sup> See e.g. discussion in FAMLNWS 2016-42, October 24, 2016, Epstein’s This Week in Family Law; and Rollie Thompson, ‘‘Legislating About Relocating: Bill C-78, N.S. &amp; B.C.” (Feb 13, 2019, Vancouver, Family Law Seminar of National Judicial Institute).</para>
<para><sup>90</sup> Section 16.92(1)(a).</para>
<para><sup>91</sup> There will of course be litigation about the meaning of ‘‘substantially equal time,” a term that is intentionally somewhat vague and does not use the 40/60 threshold for ‘‘shared custody” (or shaed parenting time) under s.9 of the Child Support Guidleines. Although the term does not appear in other legislation, it is very similar to the term ‘‘substantially equal parenting time” in the relocation scheme in the British Columbia Family Law Act. British Columbia judges generally accept that 40% of time satisfies this threshold: see M. (D.A.) v. M. (E.G.), 2014 BCSC 2091, 2014 CarswellBC 3329 (B.C. S.C.). While some BC decisions have accepted 30% of time as ‘‘substantialy equal” for this purpose (B. (C.M.) v. G. (B.D.), 2014 BCSC 780, 2014 CarswellBC 1232 (B.C. S.C.)), the courts are likely to want consistency and use 40% as the threshold for the presumption against relocation (see Hefter v. Hefter, 2016 BCSC 1504, 2016 CarswellBC 2278 (B.C. S.C.)).</para>
<para><sup>92</sup> Theterm‘‘vastmajorityoftime”isalsovague,butgiventhepolicyconcernsanddesireto promote stability, a threshold of at least 80% seem appropriate. See Bala &amp; Wheeler, ‘‘Canadian Relocation Cases: Heading Towards Guidelines” (2012) 30 Can Fam L Q 271.</para>
<para>72 CANADIAN FAMILY LAW QUARTERLY [39 C.F.L.Q.]</para>
<para>. In any other case, both parties have the burden of proof, and there is no onus or presumption about whether or not relocation should be permitted.</para>
<para>Although many cases will fall in the ‘‘grey zone” without a presumption, as a result of the enactment of Bill C-78 legal advisers will always want to consider whether parenting plans or consent orders should have a relocation restriction.<sup>93</sup> If a notice of objection is filed or there is an order prohibiting relocation, one of the factors to be taken into account by the court making a decision about relocation is whether the parenting plan or order has a term that specifies the geographic area in which the child is to reside.<sup>94</sup></para>
<para>A unilateral parental relocation of a child, either without notice, or relocation after a notice of objection is filed or if there is an order prohibiting relocation, will be held against the relocating parent in court proceedings about relocation.<sup>95</sup> These provisions in the Divorce Act should reduce the amount of litigation about relocation, and should help parents to place somewhat greater reliance on parenting agreements that include provisions about relocation; hence parents may be more likely to make agreements. Even before Bill C-78 comes into effect, those who are negotiating agreements or making orders should take into account that a clause restricting relocation may have greater effect after the new law comes into force than it does at present and the law will have this retrospective effect.</para>
<para>While there is no ‘‘perfect” scheme for addressing relocation cases, which almost always involve significant disruption for the child, whatever the outcome, the enactment of the scheme of Bill C-78 governing relocation will clearly be an improvement over the present legal quagmire. Having clear, child-focused presumptions about relocation and a clearer process will help to reduce uncertainty and litigation and help planning and settlements, though the new provisions continue to have discretionary elements and some uncertainty will remain in this area.</para>
<para><sup>93</sup> In addition to a provision prohibiting relocation with a child, a parent might want to include a term that stipulates that for the purposes of Hague Convention of Child Abduction, both parents have ‘‘rights of custody,” and can use the Convention to require return of a child wrongfully removed or retained. However, such a stipulation is not necessary for there to be the right to seek return of a child to Canada under the Convention. Article 5 of the Convention provides that for the purposes of proceedings under the Convention, ‘‘rights of custody” means rights ‘‘relating to the care of the person of the child and, in particular, the right to determine the child’s place of residence.” Under Bill C-78, a child generally cannot be relocated without a court order or the consent of both parents. So as long as a parent has the right to parenting time, that parent will also have a continuing right to determine the child’s residence, and ‘‘rights of custody” in proceedings under that the Convention, in the absence of an agreement or court order to the contrary.</para>

<para>The parenting provisions of Bill C-78 will come into force July 1, 2020. Proceedings started under the current Act will continue under the new Act, but any decision made after will be governed by the new Act provisions and should use the new terminology.<sup>96</sup> It is already common for agreements and orders to use the concepts of parenting time and parental decision-making reponsibility. The amendments provide the term ‘‘custody” used in an order under the present law will mean ‘‘parenting time and decision-making responsibility”.<sup>97</sup> The term ‘‘access” will mean ‘‘parenting time.”<sup>98</sup></para>
<para>The legislation makes clear that the coming into force of the Divorce Act parenting amendments on July 1, 2020 will not constitute a ‘‘change in circumstances of the child” and a basis for variation application.<sup>99</sup></para>
<para><b>8. CONCLUSION: CHALLENGES OF IMPLEMENTATION</b></para>
<para>Bill C-78 represents a significant and positive effort at law reform, but it will not be a panacea for the problems faced by divorcing parents and their children, and by Canada’s family justice system. There is a clear need for federal and provincial/territorial resources to support professional and public education, and a shift towards less adversarial and more child-focused resolution of family disputes. Implementing the law will create challenges, requiring changes in court rules and processes, and more significantly, will create expectations that governments, courts, and professionals will provide the services and approaches promoted by the new law.</para>
<para>In provinces like Ontario that have not recently amended their parenting legislation and that continue to use the concepts of ‘‘custody” and ‘‘access”, the enactment of Bill C-78 is creating significant pressure for law reform. Inconsistencies between federal and provincial law in this area create confusion and costs for litigants and the justice system.<sup>100</sup> Experience in provinces that have adopted new regimes, such as Alberta, British Columbia, and Nova Scotia, suggests that in practice lawyers and judges in provinces that do not reform their laws will tend to adopt the more child-focused terminology and approaches of Bill C-78. Further, there may be situations, most notably involving relocation, where the failure of a province to undertake legislative</para>

<para>Virtual parent-child contact has also increased in child welfare disputes. Yet, similar to parenting disputes, there remains little empirical research or attention to hearing directly from children and young adults about the use and impact of virtual contact and parent-child relationships, despite the focus on the best interests of children.</para>
<para>This lack of attention contrasts with the growing recognition of the importance of hearing from children either directly or indirectly.<sup>19</sup> Lawyers, mental health professionals, and judicial decision-makers rarely seek the input of children and young people about the many aspects of parenting arrangements that affect children’s lives post-separation or in child welfare disputes.<sup>20</sup></para>

<para>In order to find out what is in the best interests of children, it seems logical to find out what the children think. How can you assess a child’s best interests without hearing from the child.<sup>21</sup></para>
<para>The purpose of this study was to address this gap in the research. The objectives are threefold: (1) to explore the literature about whether and how children’s views are considered when virtual parent-child contact is being considered in parenting post-separation and in child welfare disputes; (2) to explore the views and experiences of lawyers and mental health professionals about their clients’ views and experiences with virtual technology to maintain parent-child contact post-separation and in child welfare disputes; and (3) to explore the views and experiences of parents and children between the ages of 4 to 12 in Ontario about the use of virtual contact to maintain parent-child relationships post-separation in parenting disputes.</para>
<para>This exploratory mixed-method study begins with a review of the limited literature on the use of virtual contact in parenting post-separation and in child welfare disputes. This review provides an important context on whether children and young people are consulted about their views on virtual parent-child contact post-separation and in child welfare disputes.</para>

In one study, Macdonald et al<sup>25</sup> examined the use of mobile telephone contact in Great Britain by young people in foster care and residential care, policymakers, social workers, foster parents, and residential care staff. The purpose of the study was to explore what impact, if any, the use of mobile telephone contact has on parent-child contact. The majority of young people reported that their only concern with using mobile telephone contact was that their text messages should not be read by anyone other than the person to whom it was sent. Denby-Brinson, Gomez, and Alford<sup>26</sup> explored the use of smartphones in the United States and whether or not it enhanced young people’s relationships in foster care with supportive adults (i.e. child welfare workers, parents). Young people expressed that the use of smartphones helped them connect with their family, friends, and workers and allowed them greater opportunities to strengthen their relationships by being able to have more contact through the use of technology. Denby-Brinson, Gomez, and Alford<sup>27</sup> reported that youth in the United States believed that they had a voice as a result of being able to communicate their views and preferences about their ongoing placement needs in child welfare using smartphone technology.

They found that for parents in cooperative co-parenting relationships, technology made it easier to plan activities and make decisions around their children post-separation. However, for the more conflict- driven parents, technology only served as a means to limit, manipulate and withhold information about the children as well as influence the behaviour of the co-parent.</para>
<para>Gollop and Taylor<sup>34</sup> reported on children’s and young people’s experiences with maintaining parent-child contact through virtual technology. The research was part of a larger three-year study interviewing 100 New Zealand families (i.e. parents and children) in 2010 where one parent sought to relocate. The children and young people reported that irrespective of the type of virtual technology used (i.e. Skype, email, texting, FaceTime), it was difficult and challenging to maintain contact due to interrupted telephone lines that were broken or lost, lack of immediacy with email contact and time differences as a result of geography. Children reported that they preferred face-to-face contact. In their larger study, parents reported that technology could be used as a ‘‘weapon” (i.e. surveillance of their children with their other parent, refusal to purchase or connect the equipment) for the sole purpose of frustrating the residential parent and child.<sup>35</sup></para>
<para>Saini et al<sup>36</sup> reviewed the limited body of literature on virtual parent-child contact within the context of separation and divorce.

Saini and Polak<sup>37</sup> explored survey results of legal and mental professionals and their views and experiences about the use and impact of virtual technology to maintain parent-child contact post-separation. They found both benefits and challenges to the use of technology, particularly with high conflict separated families (i.e. those with poor problem-solving skills, poor communication skills, and who are conflict-oriented) who could not cooperate or interfered with the other parent’s parenting time during parent-child contact. They concluded that there needs to be more assistance provided for high conflict parents; these parents need to be offered guidance and structure (i.e. rules) in parenting plans when virtual technology is being used as a means of contact post-separation and divorce.</para>

<para>In summary, while the studies about parental separation and the use of virtual technology to maintain parent-child contact remain limited, a number of observations can be made. While virtual technology has the potential for maintaining parent-child contact post-separation, there needs to be more research that includes the views of children and young people as well as parents about the risks and rewards of virtual parent-child contact. Regardless of the type of virtual technology being used, not all parents and children can afford the technology and not all parents live in areas that have reliable internet services. In addition, not all parents want the added demands of being responsible for organizing virtual parent-child contact, particularly for children who need adult assistance. Family justice professionals need to be mindful not to promote ‘‘virtual parenting” as a replacement for actual face-to-face parent-child contact. Finally, children and young people must be consulted when it comes to formulating parenting arrangements using any form of virtual technology to maintain parent-child contact post-separation.</para>
<para>This study is part of a broader research agenda exploring children’s participation post-separation. The focus of this paper is on the views and experiences of mental health professionals, lawyers, children and young people, and parents about the challenges and benefits of using virtual technology as a means of parent-child contact post-separation and in child welfare disputes.</para>
<para><b>4. THE STUDY</b></para>
<para><b>(a) Method</b></para>
<para>There were two separate but interrelated mixed-method studies. The first study was a 37-item online survey sent to mental health professionals and lawyers. This survey consisted of both closed and open-ended questions. The second study was based on telephone interviews with 10 children (ages 4 to 12) and 7 parents (3 parents of the 10 children were interviewed with their child) in Ontario. The parents and children were purposively recruited participants through the use of family justice newsletters, university news, as well as email invitations to interdisciplinary organizations.</para>
<para>The online survey questions for family justice professionals related to: (1) demographics (i.e. age, gender, professional designation, years of practice in family justice, years of practice as a child custody assessor, years of practice in representing children); (2) percentage of practice representing family law clients, child welfare clients, and children; (3) beliefs about the age range of children to use Skype, FaceTime, etc. with the other parent, with and without adult assistance; (4) how often adult clients reported conflicts in using Skype, FaceTime, etc.; and (5) how often child clients reported conflicts in using Skype, FaceTime, etc.</para>
<para>The qualitative interviews were solely focused on separated parents and young people in parenting disputes.<sup>38</sup> Each parent was asked to comment on the</para>
<para>VIRTUAL PARENT-CHILD CONTACT POST-SEPARATION 83</para>
<para>length of the separation, the type of technology used to maintain parent-child contact with the non-resident parent, their views and experiences with virtual technology as a means of parent-child contact with the non-resident parent, as well as the challenges and benefits of virtual technology relating to confidentiality and safety. The final question asked each parent if they had any other comments they wanted to share about the use of technology in the context of virtual parent-child contact. Each child was asked to comment on the type of technology used with their non-resident parent and how often it was used, their views and experiences with virtual technology when used with their non- resident parent to maintain contact, and if they had any other comments they wanted to share about technology in general or about its use with their non- resident parent.</para>
<para>Using a mixed-method study of both quantitative and qualitative methods expands our understanding of exploring virtual technology as a means of parent- child contact with evidence-informed data. Adopting a mixed-methods approach provides greater confidence in a singular conclusion and we can modify interpretations and conclusions accordingly.<sup>39</sup> The qualitative data provides context to better understand the real-world experiences of children, parents, mental health professionals, and lawyers, and provides insight to ‘‘make sense of quantitative results and thereby produces a much richer knowledge base.”<sup>40</sup></para>
<para><b>(b) Data Analyses</b></para>
<para>For this study qualitative analyses used a grounded theory approach given the limited knowledge in this area.<sup>41</sup> Grounded theory is about constructing meanings/concepts through the gathering of the interview data and analyzing the themes that are being generated by parents and children. The first set of themes are done by open coding (i.e. developing categories of information and reducing the data into concepts), followed by axial coding (i.e. creating a coding structure that portrays the interrelationships between the information obtained) and then conducting selective coding (i.e. telling the story based on the categories and interrelationships found in the data). Quantitative analyses focused on</para>

<para>‘‘It is a source of evidence about the parent’s ability to cooperate and whether they can reasonably make decisions about the child’s best interests. More rarely, it is also used to establish a prior inconsistent statement. The benefits are significant since the lack of physical presence can assist clients to calm down in high conflict cases. At the same time, some clients incorrectly try to use the medium to set up traps for the other parent or engage in what they see is a strategic maneuver in litigation.” (male lawyer)</para>
<para><i>(v) Benefits and Challenges of Using Online Technology in Child Welfare Disputes</i></para>
<para>Professionals were also asked to comment about their views on the benefits and challenges of using online technology as a means of parent-child contact in child welfare disputes. Comments raised include:</para>
<para>‘‘Benefits: more readily accessible and flexible communication tools. Negatives: unsupervised, mis-use, concealed communications, etc.” (female social worker)</para>
<para>‘‘Access to technology; most child welfare families have limited access to technology or if they do have smartphones, can’t afford the data to use tech—dependent on free WiFi and it is in public places so no privacy/confidentiality.” (female lawyer)</para>
<para>‘‘Technology is a magnificent tool for lawyers. They have high expectations and high dependency on technology. It cannot replace, however, the skills needed to inquire, listen, focus on facts, isolate reasonable conclusions, advise, encourage, and support children and families within the remit of a lawyer. Technology in litigation, like a car on an open road, is a wonderful and beneficial thing in experienced hands but one moment of inattention or one wrong move and there’s damage everywhere.” (male lawyer)</para>
<para>VIRTUAL PARENT-CHILD CONTACT POST-SEPARATION 89</para>
<para><b>5. QUALITATIVE THEMES: VIEWS AND EXPERIENCES OF CHILDREN AND PARENTS ABOUT THE USE OF VIRTUAL TECHNOLOGY FOR PARENT-CHILD CONTACT</b></para>
<para>In total there were 10 children (6 females and 4 males) ranging in age from 4 to 12 (the average age was 10) and 7 parents who were interviewed<sup>46</sup> (5 mothers and 2 fathers). Of the 7 parents, 3 of the parents were interviewed separately with the children. The parents were separated and/or divorced between 2 to 5 years; 8 of the children lived in the primary custody of their mother, one child with their father and one child lived in a shared care parenting arrangement. Five of the parents had some form of court-ordered virtual parent-child contact using either Skype or FaceTime with the non-resident parent, and the remaining (i.e. including children) reported that they made their own parenting arrangements about using virtual technology as a means of parent-child contact.</para>
<para><b>(a) Parent Themes</b></para>
<para>The parents’ interviews raised both benefits and challenges of the use of virtual technology as a means of parent-child contact post-separation. The themes and supporting evidence cluster in four major areas that relate to both risks and rewards.</para>
<para><i>(i) Risks</i></para>
<para><i>(1) Feeling that the resident parent is interfering in parent-child contact</i></para>
<para>A father reported concerns about his child being able to transport the technological device back/forth:</para>
<para>Another father raised a concern of:</para>
<para>‘‘She [8-year-old] also has a computer but her mom prevents her from taking her computer back/forth, so, like she has one with me but she [mother] doesn’t allow her [child] to take it home, so she can use it as well.”</para>
<para>‘‘The constant interruptions from mum, and you know mum will come in, and start waving or making silly faces behind child even though I can see her [mum] as can child.”</para>
<para><i>(2) Concerns about safety and vulnerability</i></para>
<para>One mother stated:</para>
<para>‘‘He [non-resident father] set her [daughter] up in a private account and blocked me [mother].”</para>

<para>90 CANADIAN FAMILY LAW QUARTERLY [39 C.F.L.Q.]</para>
<para>Another mother stated she monitored the telephone calls between the child and the other parent because:</para>
<para>‘‘The children [ages 4 and 10] would often walk around the house with the telephone and show him what was in the house. . . it was uncomfortable for me [resident parent].”</para>
<para>One father reported being accused of manipula ting the type of communication:</para>
<para>‘‘I faced allegations from her [resident parent] that I was manipulating all three kinds of communication for submission to the courts, which isn’t the case.”</para>
<para><i>(3) Concerns about privacy and confidentiality</i></para>
<para>One father reported that:</para>
<para>One mother reported that:</para>
<para>‘‘Assessor can pop in and have a look and see correspondence going back/forth, because there are court orders in place that tell you you’re not to speak to the other person and there is all kinds, I have been subjected to all kinds of various forms of harassment.”</para>
<para>‘‘Not sure I like my child being online and an open communication as there is no real privacy and worry about pictures being taken and then sent somewhere.”</para>
<para><i>(ii) Rewards</i></para>
<para><i>(4) Reduced conflict between parents</i></para>
<para>One mother reported:</para>
<para>‘‘I mean it cuts down the number of conflicts that can be brought up which tends to happen when you have swaps, you know take this weekend for that weekend [Skype court-ordered for mid-week access as child had every other weekend access].”</para>
<para>One father stated that while they have no agreement for virtual contact:</para>
<para>‘‘It [FaceTime] has been really helpful for the parental relationship as son just calls when he [son] wants and that is fine.”</para>
<para><i>(5) Allows children to maintain parent-child relationships with both parents</i></para>
<para>One mother stated:</para>
<para>‘‘We share custody of the 2 children and Google calendaring as well as FaceTime allows the girls to be able to have access to both of us and they [girls] manage it well. . . just enforcing that either parent can be accessible to the children whenever they need us, lessens their feelings of</para>

<para>‘‘Once we started using this technology [FaceTime], it made all the difference in the world because she can see me, I can see her, we talk. . . if I am away at work, I can show her where I am and make her feel she’s there with me.”</para>
<para><b>(b) Children’s Themes</b></para>
<para>The children raised both risks and benefits with virtual parenting time. The following themes emerged:</para>
<para><i>(1) Feelings of closeness with non-resident parent and reservations at same time</i></para>
<para>One 10-year-old female [mother interviewed separately as well] stated:</para>
<para>‘‘Ya, it’s pretty awesome, but I would obviously rather be able to see him. . . but online. . . being able to play games with him or see his face is pretty cool.”</para>
<para>Another 12-year-old female stated:</para>
<para>‘‘While it is really great to see my dad, I want to feel him near me as well.”</para>
<para><i>(2) Resident parent interferes with access time and issues of privacy for child</i></para>
<para>A 10-year-old female stated:</para>
<para>Another 12-year-old male reported:</para>
<para>‘‘My mother is around [listens] as she wants to hear what he [father] says.”</para>
<para>‘‘My mom is always asking me how it’s going and how long will I be online with my dad.”</para>
<para><i>(3) Longing for non-resident parent</i></para>
<para>One 11-year-old male stated:</para>
<para>‘‘Well one thing I don’t like about this [virtual contact] is I can’t actually see him in person. . . it’s sad, but good at same time [I can see him, on the screen at least].”</para>
<para>Another 11-year-old male reported:</para>
<para>‘‘When I am home alone, I want to call him.”</para>
<para><i>(4) Often not available at appointed time</i></para>

<para>Another 10-year-old female reported:</para>
<para>‘‘I am supposed to call [FaceTime] on Monday and Wednesday, most of the time I can’t really make it, but it creates problems for my dad who gets upset.”</para>
<para>‘‘I like talking to him but sometimes I am busy, and he gets upset as I want to get off.”</para>
<para><b>6. LIMITATIONS</b></para>
<para>As with all studies, this study too, had several limitations that need to be highlighted. Given the exploratory nature of this study and the few empirical studies that address the use of virtual technology as a means of parent-child contact, more research is required before any practice or policy determinations can be made. As stated earlier, the majority of parents and children in this study were court-ordered to have virtual contact and lived primarily with their mothers. There were two cases where the non-resident parent lived in another jurisdiction.</para>
<para>The limited sample size and exploratory nature of this study precludes any recommendations. However, court-ordered and voluntary agreements for virtual parent-child contact as well as different types of parenting arrangements are important research topics that need to be addressed in future studies. Additionally, the age range of the children in this study raises questions about the type of technology being used and how much adult assistance is required. This may be of particular concern for those children who have special needs (i.e. cerebral palsy, on the autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy). Future research also needs to explore the impact and use of virtual technology for these children as well as their parents.</para>
<para>Finally, the sample of mental health and legal professionals surveyed and children and parents interviewed was small and exploratory in nature. Therefore, caution must be exercised as the findings cannot be generalized more broadly.</para>
<para><b>7. DISCUSSION</b></para>
<para>This is the first study that draws on multiple perspectives about the views and experiences of family justice professionals (i.e. lawyers and mental health professionals), their comments from parent and child clients, as well as comments from children and parents directly about their views and experiences with virtual technology as a means of parent-child contact. Findings reveal a number of risks and benefits based on the different perspectives about virtual parent-child contact. Professionals are seeing a rise in court orders using virtual technology as a means of parent-child contact in both parenting and child welfare disputes despite the lack of empirical studies to help guide practitioners and the courts.</para>
<para>VIRTUAL PARENT-CHILD CONTACT POST-SEPARATION 93</para>
<para>From the perspective of parent reports to lawyers about virtual parent-child contact, a number of concerns were highlighted. One concern related to the resident parent listening in on the conversation between their child and the non- resident parent. The second concern was related to the resident parent being responsible for making sure that the child is available at the specified time. In the parent interviews, the greatest concerns centred on safety and feeling vulnerable during the parent-child virtual contact as well as privacy issues. That is, parents raised concerns about being blocked from accessing the technology being used by the non-resident parent and the child, invasion of privacy and feelings of being monitored (i.e. resident as well as non-resident parents), and the unfettered virtual access to the resident parent’s home. This latter theme raises concerns for high conflict parents as well as those where domestic violence is a serious concern.</para>
<para>Having said this, there were also a number of benefits highlighted as a result of virtual parent-child contact in both the parental reports to their lawyers as well as in the parent interviews. These themes are similar to the findings in Wolman and Pomerance.<sup>47</sup> The greatest benefit raised by each parent is that the child can maintain an ongoing parental relationship and that virtual parent-child contact provides reduced hostilities between the parents because they have no contact with one another other than organizing the call if the child requires adult assistance.</para>
<para>While it is important to obtain different perspectives (i.e. children, parents, lawyers, family justice professionals) about the emerging use of parent-child contact via virtual technology, it is also important to acknowledge that more research is needed to unpack any cultural nuances. That is, not all parents and children are comfortable with the use of technology or want to use technology as a means of parent-child communication. In addition, there are barriers to the use of technology (i.e. rural versus urban areas) as well as the relative burdens and costs (i.e. emotional and financial) to parents as the use of virtual parent-child contact moves forward in the age of technology. Moreover, children and young people must be consulted about their views and experiences, particularly depending on their needs as not all children, irrespective of age, want to commit themselves to a particular date and time. It is also very important to examine the safety risks underlying the use of virtual communication tools especially relating to high conflict cases where domestic violence (i.e. stalking) can be an issue.</para>
<para>More importantly, there needs to be a focus on unpacking some of the underlying assumptions about parenting via the virtual world—that is, what does ‘‘virtual parenting” mean to children and young people, in particular. As poignantly stated by a 12-year-old female, ‘‘While it is great to see my dad, I want to feel him near me as well”, and by an 11-year-old male, ‘‘I can’t really see him in person. . . it’s sad, but good at the same time.”</para>

<para><b>Case Comment: Undermining Children’s Rights in <i>A.M. v. C.H.</i></b></para>
<para>Claire Houston<sup>*</sup></para>
<para><b>1. INTRODUCTION</b></para>
<para>The recent Ontario case of A.M. v. C.H.<sup>1</sup> is troubling on multiple levels. The case involved a 14-year-old boy who was resisting contact with his father. The trial judge found that the mother had alienated the child from the father, despite evidence that the boy’s resistance was justified. The trial judge transferred custody to the father and suspended access between the child and the mother. The trial judge refused to review the order until the child agreed to ‘‘reconciliation therapy” with his father. After the custody transfer, the child assaulted the father, was criminally charged, and—prohibited from contact with the mother—was placed in foster care where he was seriously assaulted.<sup>2</sup> Yet the significance of A.M. v. C.H. goes beyond its troubling facts. The trial judge’s decision and the Court of Appeal’s subsequent endorsement of that decision have implications for children’s rights more generally. This comment argues that A.M. v. C.H. threatens children’s rights in parenting disputes by allowing a judicial finding of alienation to silence children’s views, making it easier to reprimand custodial parents by transferring custody of children, and depriving capable children of autonomy to make treatment decisions.</para>
<para><b>2. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</b></para>
<para><b>(a) The Trial Decision</b></para>
<para>The central issue in the case was the child’s contact with his father. The parties had three children. At the time of trial, only the 14-year-old remained the subject of the application.<sup>3</sup> In the summer of 2014, the mother and children moved out of the matrimonial home. In July 2014, an interim order granted the father access to the children every Sunday as well as every Wednesday evening,</para>

<para><sup>3</sup> The parties’ other children were now 18 and 19 years old, respectively.</para>
<para>100 CANADIAN FAMILY LAW QUARTERLY [39 C.F.L.Q.]</para>
<para>and the Ontario Office of the Children’s Lawyer (‘‘OCL”) was appointed to represent the children. By late 2016, the child was seeing his father for 45 to 60 minutes a week. The child consistently stated that he did not enjoy access visits with his father and did not want the visits to continue. Attempts at ‘‘reconciliation therapy” were unsuccessful, and different access arrangements did not change the child’s views.</para>
<para>The parties disagreed about the source of the child’s views. The father argued that the child’s views were a product of the mother’s alienating conduct and attitudes. He testified to the mother’s attempts to turn the children against him pre-separation,<sup>4</sup> and her false allegations that he abused her and the children. The mother had unilaterally moved the children to a different city following separation and had brought a motion to terminate the father’s access. There was evidence that she did not believe the children needed a relationship with their father. While the mother admitted that she exaggerated some of her abuse claims during the proceedings, she argued that the child’s views were justified by the father’s violence and cruelty. In fact, the father admitted spanking the child and repeatedly calling the child a ‘‘donkey” because of the child’s learning disability.<sup>5</sup></para>
<para>The OCL took the position that the child was realistically estranged from his father. The OCL social worker assisting child’s counsel agreed that the mother’s negative feelings toward the father had contributed to the child’s views. However, she believed that the mother’s alienating behaviour had dissipated and, more importantly, that the child’s views were also shaped by the child’s experiences with his father, including his physical discipline and name-calling.<sup>6</sup> The OCL’s view was that the child was ‘‘not. . . an alienated child.”<sup>7</sup> Given the child’s age, the independence of his views, and the fact that his views had remained strong and consistent despite various efforts to promote a relationship between the child and his father, the OCL argued that access be terminated, take place at the child’s discretion, or be reduced.</para>
<para>The trial judge transferred custody of the child from the mother to the father and suspended access between the mother and child (and between the child and his siblings) for at least six months. Although there was no expert evidence countering the OCL social worker’s view, the trial judge found that the child’s rejection of his father was solely due to the mother’s alienating behaviour.<sup>8</sup> According to the trial judge, the father’s past conduct played no part in shaping</para>
<para><sup>4</sup> For example, the father testified that the mother criticized him in front of the children, would lock him out of the house after arguments, and that the mother and the children would not allow him to eat with them: Malhotra 2018, supra note 1 at paras. 26-27.</para>

He has been poisoned against his father and his views are not his own.”<sup>10</sup> While the trial judge acknowledged that the child would ‘‘initially struggle tremendously” from the change in custody, he reasoned that the child’s long-term best interests would be served by facilitating the child’s relationship with the father and protecting the child from the mother’s alienation, which he described as ‘‘emotional abuse.”<sup>11</sup> The change was further justified, explained the trial judge, because he ‘‘expect[ed] the Respondent Mother and the child may completely disobey any access order I make.”<sup>12</sup> Finally, noting that the child was refusing ‘‘reconciliation therapy,” the trial judge nonetheless directed that the court would not review the custody or access order for six months and until the child had participated in such therapy.<sup>13</sup></para>
<para><b>(b) Additional Reasons</b></para>
<para>Less than three months after the trial decision, the parties were back before the trial judge. The transfer of custody had not gone well. Police involvement had been necessary to deliver the child to the father’s custody.<sup>14</sup> The child had repeatedly run away from the father’s home to the mother’s home and the police had been called to return the child to the father. The child had vandalized the father’s house. He had also refused to attend ‘‘reconciliation therapy.” The father sought various orders to compel the child and the mother to comply with the trial decision; the mother asked for some access to the child. The child asked to meet with the judge.</para>
<para>The trial judge made several orders in favour of the father to reinforce the trial decision, refused the mother’s request for access, and declined to meet with the child. The trial judge blamed the mother for the child’s refusal ‘‘to submit to his father’s authority.”<sup>15</sup> First, her alienating behaviour had caused the child to reject his father: ‘‘[u]nbeknowst to [the child], his mother ha[s] been systematically poisoning his mind against his father and thereby emotionally abusing him for many years.”<sup>16</sup> Given this brainwashing, it was pointless,</para>

<para>explained the trial judge, for him to meet with the child ‘‘until [the child] has meaningfully engaged in reconciliation counselling and [has begun] to appreciate, through that therapeutic process, that a relationship with his father is in his best interest.”<sup>17</sup> Second, the mother’s refusal to accept the trial decision, exemplified in part by her appeal of that decision, was causing the child not to comply with its terms. To buttress the trial decision, the trial judge ordered that the child have no contact with his maternal grandparents, that he obey certain rules in his father’s home, and that he ‘‘accept and attend” ‘‘reconciliation therapy” with his father.<sup>18</sup></para>
<para><b>(c) Court of Appeal Decision</b></para>
<para>By the time the case reached the Ontario Court of Appeal (‘‘OCA”), the child was in crisis or, as the OCA put it, ‘‘[t]he child has behaved badly.”<sup>19</sup> He had continued to run away from the father’s home, requiring police assistance for his return. He had assaulted the father and been criminally charged. The charges resulted in a prohibition of contact between the child and the father. Since the child was prohibited from contact with the mother, he was placed in foster care. While in care, the child was seriously assaulted by another youth, requiring plates to be implanted in his face. Moreover, the child was ‘‘even more entrenched in his attitude towards his father.”<sup>20</sup></para>
<para>The Court of Appeal upheld the trial decision despite its devastating impact on the child. The mother and the OCL advanced several grounds of appeal, including that the trial judge failed to give effect to the child’s wishes and overemphasized the mother’s bad conduct; that the transfer of custody was inappropriate; and that the trial judge erred in ordering the child to participate in ‘‘reconciliation therapy” without his consent, contrary to the principles governing consent in Ontario’s Health Care Consent Act (‘‘HCCA”).<sup>21</sup> The Court of Appeal held that the trial judge had jurisdiction to find that the mother had alienated the child and that this alienation had rendered the children’s views meaningless: the trial judge was ‘‘entitled to put no weight on the child’s wishes.”<sup>22</sup> The Court also found that the transfer of custody was appropriate to protect the child from the mother and facilitate a relationship between the child and the father. The order was meant to promote the child’s ‘‘long-term best interests,” explained the Court, ‘‘not to punish the mother.”<sup>23</sup></para>

<para>The Court of Appeal also affirmed the trial judge’s order that the child attend therapy. Ontario’s HCCA prohibits health practitioners from administering treatment to a ‘‘capable” individual without their consent. The Act presumes that every person, including a child, is capable of consenting to (or refusing) treatment.<sup>24</sup> According to the Court, these provisions do not prevent a court from ordering a non-consenting child to attend therapy pursuant to the Divorce Act or Children’s Law Reform Act (‘‘CLRA”). The Divorce Act and CLRA empower judges to ‘‘make orders about almost any aspect of the child’s life,” including therapy, where the parents cannot agree.<sup>25</sup> The Divorce Act and the CLRA prioritize a child’s ‘‘best interests,” explained the Court, whereas the HCCA promotes autonomy. Moreover, while the Child, Youth and Family Services Act (‘‘CYFSA”),<sup>26</sup> Ontario’s child protection legislation, specifically directs judges to follow the HCCA, including when contemplating an order for therapy, the Divorce Act and CLRA do not mention the HCCA. This is not to say a child’s views with respect to treatment are irrelevant under the Divorce Act or CLRA. A child’s views and preferences are one factor in considering the child’s best interests. Citing the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in Manitoba (Director of Child &amp; Family Services) v. C. (A.)

<para>While children have a right to participate in parenting disputes, their views are not necessarily determinative. Article 12 of the CRC directs that a child’s views be given due weight in accordance with the child’s age and maturity.<sup>31</sup> Maturity refers to a child’s capacity to express views that are reasonable and independent.<sup>32</sup> In cases involving alienation, courts have questioned the independence of children’s views and therefore accorded them less weight.<sup>33</sup></para>
<para>However, current research on alienation suggests that judges should be careful in finding alienation and discounting children’s views on this basis. Mental health professionals increasingly view parent-child contact problems as multi-factorial.<sup>34</sup> They suggest that blaming a child’s refusal or resistance to contact with one parent on the other parent’s alienating behaviour is generally too simplistic.<sup>35</sup> It is also often unhelpful, since labeling a case one of ‘‘alienation” keeps the focus on parental discord and mutual blaming.<sup>36</sup> And it may be harmful, because it forecloses consideration of other factors that may be contributing to a child’s resistance, such as abusive parenting.<sup>37</sup> It is also difficult to differentiate these cases, even for clinicians who work with families experiencing parent-child contact problems.

<para>A.M. v. C.H. sets a dangerous precedent for children’s participation rights in parenting cases by allowing a judicial finding of alienation to silence children’s views.<sup>39</sup> While the views and preferences of the child were brought before the trial court, they were given ‘‘no weight.” This effectively rendered the child’s right to participation meaningless: for what is the value of the right to be heard if you are told your views do not matter? As Justice Perkins explained in L. (N.) v. M. (R.R.), ‘‘The wishes of an alienated child may be warped and misconceived, but they are nonetheless real.”<sup>40</sup> Moreover, the trial judge was able to ignore the child’s views based on his own finding of alienation. The trial judge’s identification of alienation as the sole cause of the child’s resistance to contact with his father is problematic given the multi-factorial nature of parent-child contact problems. In fact, the evidence in this case clearly suggested that multiple factors had contributed to the child’s resistance. For example, the OCL social worker testified that the father’s conduct had also played a role, evidence the trial judge disregarded and the Court of Appeal failed to mention. A.M. v. C.H. thus allows trial judges to make simplistic alienation findings about complex parent- child contact problems and use these findings to disregard children’s views.</para>

<para>contempt have been established, judges must exercise their discretion to decide whether a contempt finding is appropriate. Specifically, judges must consider whether there are alternatives to finding contempt and, if there are children involved, whether such a finding would be in the best interests of the children. For example, in Ruffolo v. David, the Court found that engaging professionals to speak to and work with children refusing access was preferable to finding a custodial parent in contempt.<sup>44</sup></para>
<para>A.M. v. C.H. raises concerns about trial judges using the ‘‘drastic”<sup>45</sup> remedy of transferring custody to punish custodial parents for denying access without having to consider the restrictions around contempt orders. The Court of Appeal described the transfer of custody as promoting the child’s best interests, not punishing the mother. However, the trial judge’s reasons suggest that holding the mother accountable was a factor in making the order. The trial judge noted that the mother had made it ‘‘abundantly clear” that she had no desire to participate in reconciliation therapy,<sup>46</sup> that she was unlikely to comply with any order for therapy or attempts at reconciliation, and that he expected the mother ‘‘may completely disobey any access order I make.”<sup>47</sup> The trial judge also made orders to reinforce the transfer of custody on the basis that the mother was not supporting the child’s compliance with the original order. In using a parenting order to, at least in part, hold the mother accountable for her past—and future—failures to comply with access provisions, the trial judge was able to transfer custody without having to consider alternative remedies that would have been less damaging to the child.<sup>48</sup></para>

<para>Nor, in Ontario, may the state, acting in the place of a parent, make treatment decisions for a capable child. Section 111(2) of the CYFSA provides that where a child is in ‘‘extended society care,” a Children’s Aid Society may provide consent to treatment on behalf of the child only where the child is ‘‘incapable of consenting to treatment” under the HCCA.<sup>51</sup> In other words, a society, exercising the rights and responsibilities of a parent, cannot consent to treatment on behalf of a capable child. Section 110(2) says the same limitation applies to capable children in ‘‘interim society care”: a society cannot consent to treatment on their behalf.<sup>52</sup></para>
<para>The Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in A.C., on which the Court of Appeal in A.M. v. C.H. relies, considered Manitoba’s Child and Family Services Act,<sup>53</sup> which has different rules respecting the treatment of minors than Ontario’s CYFSA. The provisions of the Manitoba Act at issue in that case expressly authorized a court to order treatment of a child under 16, even where the child was capable of consenting to treatment, where such treatment was in the child’s ‘‘best interests.” The case involved a challenge by a 14-year-old, who argued that the statutory override was unconstitutional because it prevented capable children under 16 from making treatment decisions. A majority of the Supreme Court held that the statutory override did not violate the Charter so long as ‘‘best interests” was interpreted to give greater weight to the child’s treatment wishes in accordance with the child’s maturity. Ontario’s CYFSA and HCCA do not define a statutory age of capacity. Thus, the Supreme Court’s ‘‘best interests” analysis in <i>A.C.</i>, which was based on express statutory authority, does not apply to capable children in Ontario.</para>
<para>The Court of Appeal’s decision in A.M. v. C.H. suggests that courts can override the treatment decisions of capable children in the specific context of parenting disputes.<sup>54</sup> This is inconsistent with how Ontario law approaches capable children’s treatment decisions both under the HCCA and CYFSA.

<para><sup>54</sup> The Court of Appeal did not determine whether the child was capable of refusing therapy: A.M. v. C.H., supra note 1 at para. 77. There is an argument that a child refusing counseling who is subjected to a parent’s alienating behaviour is not capable of making this treatment decision because they do not understand the information relevant to making the decision or are unable to appreciate the reasonably foreseeable consequences of consenting to or refusing therapy. This argument, similar to the trial judge’s finding that the child’s alienation rendered his views irrelevant, could also be used to undermine children’s autonomy to make health care decisions.</para>

<para>their parents, it can make treatment decisions for capable children where their parents have separated. It also suggests that a judge, acting under the Divorce Act or CLRA, could make a treatment decision for a capable child that a parent could not, since parents in Ontario can never make treatment decisions for their capable children. Following the Court of Appeal’s reasoning, a judge hearing a child protection matter has no power to prevent a capable child from refusing even life-saving treatment while the same judge hearing a child custody matter involving the same child could order the child to receive such treatment.<sup>55</sup> While the latter decision might well be in the child’s ‘‘best interests,” with respect, this is not the appropriate test. It was the test in A.C. because the Manitoba Act gave express statutory authority to override a capable child’s treatment decision. For capable children in Ontario, children’s autonomy in making treatment decisions trumps a judge’s assessment, or for that matter a parent’s assessment, of what is in the child’s ‘‘best interests.”</para>
<para><b>4. CONCLUSION</b></para>
<para>We recently learned that the child in A.M. v. C.H. has apologized to his father and is now living with him.<sup>56</sup> While a positive development, it is hard to say the transfer of custody was justified given the trauma and violence the child experienced.<sup>57</sup> The significance of A.M. v. C.H., however, goes beyond thinking how the case might have been better handled. The case also raises concerns about children’s participation rights in alienation cases, the ease with which judges may be able to transfer custody to sanction parents for access interference, and children’s autonomy to make treatment decisions in the context of parental disputes. Whatever the eventual outcome for the child in A.M. v. C.H., the case should be read as a troubling decision for children’s rights generally.</para>
